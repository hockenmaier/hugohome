                    <description><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="/raspberry-pi-panel">home automation dashboard</a> broke down in two ways this year. Hardware, then software. My wife and I really liked this dashboard. It saved us from pulling out our phones and getting sucked into emails or social media while we were supposed to be living our lives.</p>
<p>Both breakdowns ended up in rebuilds. The hardware obviously solved by 3D modeling and printing and the software part became another problem I would vibe code - no - vibe engineer - my way out of.</p>
<p>After rebuilding, it is totally different. But cooler perhaps? And everything it uses should last many decades this time, instead of just one decade.</p>
<p>Let me break it down for you:</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-build">The Build</h1>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p><strong>First breakdown:</strong> the screen finally died with one of the LED rows failing. It was a trooper. This meant updating to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P8P3X6M">new version of the screen</a></p>
<p>And the slight physical difference of the board components meant I had to redesign how I mounted it to the wall, from a complete enclosure that attached via mounting tape to a new slim set of custom brackets I made taking advantage of the standard screw mounts on the screen’s PCB:</p>
<div class="paige-row-wide">
  <div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:repeat(2, minmax(0,1fr)); gap:15px;">

<img   class="rounded-3 w-100"  crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/new-mount.webp"    >

</div>
</div>

<p>Old enclosure left, new mounts right (almost invisible in white like the wall). It&rsquo;s much more secure, much less plastic and a good general purpose mount for raw PCB 7-inch displays. Printed in <a href="https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/abs-filament?srsltid=AfmBOopWZrOOFNoQS26lx71-xycEFqOJ3GG7-FllK-4zYhuttsgHJYb5&id=40475105493128">glossy white ABS</a> to last forever and match the walls.</p>
<p>I posted them on Thingiverse here: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7226385">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7226385</a></p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong>Second breakdown:</strong> And the timing here was perfectly ironic - about a month after I got this new screen and made the slim mount, the software I was using to display the dashboard just gave up. That software was called <a href="http://actiontiles.com/">ActionTiles</a> and yes, that domain is gone because everything about the product disappeared about 20 days before I am posting this. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartThings/comments/1p2ya18/action_tiles/">The subreddit</a> didn’t know what was happening but as best I can tell, it sounds like the solo developer unfortunately passed away several years ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately ActionTiles was not open source for me to host it myself, nor does it seem worth the effort to integrate with the SmartThings API myself (I am considering moving to an open source home hub after lackluster support for SmartThings anyway), so my next course of action was to vibe code myself another dashboard. This one is less focused on home automation but equally useful to us.</p>
<p>Over the course of some prompting and <a href="https://openai.com/codex/">Codex</a> PRs, the final result shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The weather now and for the next week</li>
<li>Upcoming birthdays on my wife&rsquo;s and my shared birthday Google sheet</li>
<li>How many months old baby Alice is</li>
<li>Upcoming SpaceX launches visible from my house, with pulsing backgrounds an hour before each launch</li>
<li>The time and date in a nice format</li>
<li>Other astronomical events like meteor showers and eclipses</li>
<li>Plus holidays and solstices</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the end result:</p>

Apologies to readers on phone.. this dashboard is hardcoded for fixed size a 16/9 layout.</p>
<p>I was aiming for clean, simple, readable, and things Kaitlin and I were always looking at our phones to find out. It doesn&rsquo;t do the same things as the previous dashboard but it reduces the number of times my phone has to come out even more than the previous one. We&rsquo;ve been really enjoying it!</p>
<p>I learned some interesting things throughout this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are surprisingly good APIs out there for weather and forecasts despite the absolutely <strong>abysmal</strong> mobile weather app market</li>
<li>Meteor showers don&rsquo;t need an API because they happen the same time every year</li>
<li>Eclipses basically don&rsquo;t either cause you can just hard code out all the eclipse data with a few kilobytes of data for decades into the future</li>
<li>The SpaceX upcoming launches list, despite being fully open and probably the simplest of all the data sets here to work with, was by far the most challenging for my AI assistant to read from. This is where the hosted AI coders fall down a lot: their environments simply are different than the ones we are using and they have a hard time accessing stuff that should be open. When they finally figure out how to do that, they have such short memories that they forget things like “only show launches from Vandenberg&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with almost everything on this site, it&rsquo;s totally open source and this one&rsquo;s contained in a single ~1000-line html file. If you want, you can throw this into your favorite AI model and ask it to change it to events you care about and weather in your location.</p>
<p> 
 </p>
<h1 id="vibe-coding-or-vibe-engineering">Vibe Coding? Or Vibe Engineering?</h1>
<p>Here is where I launch into another breakdown of AI software development. I feel the need to write about it every time I wrap another project, because it&rsquo;s changing so quickly.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://openai.com/codex/">Codex</a>, mostly, to build this dashboard. I like Codex <a href="/on-ai-software-development-2/#autonomous-coding-agents">because it makes more sense to me to have AI models make discrete code changes and pull-request them into my project rather than trying to work in the same IDE as the AI</a>.</p>
<p>Every time I &ldquo;vibe code&rdquo; something new, I find new ways to be amazed and disappointed by these thinking machines. The main takeaway I had this time is, despite the amazing speed of development, I just can&rsquo;t see anyone other than an engineer getting a workable software product out of these models in 2025.</p>
<p>This is why the term “vibe engineering” is growing on me. Now that the basic code writes itself, what I see engineers doing all day are things <em>around</em> the code like making sure environments work and making sure features don&rsquo;t conflict. And, most key of all: determining the actual specific logic of the product. Check out the detail in my original prompt for this dashboard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please create a new dashboard at <a href="https://hockenworks.com/html/home-calendar.html">https://hockenworks.com/html/home-calendar.html</a>.</p>
<p>It will function as a standalone servable page like <a href="https://hockenworks.com/html/agent-mode-solar-system-self-contained.html">https://hockenworks.com/html/agent-mode-solar-system-self-contained.html</a>.</p>
<p>This is going to be permanently displayed on a small 16/9 touchscreen in our kitchen running on chromium on Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>On the right part of the screen (a full square aligned with the left side of the 16 by 9 screen) will be a calendar. That calendar should display the current week and next 7 weeks on a 7 by seven grid, using your stylistic preferences to denote the dates and days of the week. Draw a bold line horizontally and vertically through month breaks with a clear delineation between the two.</p>
<p>This calendar should use public data which does not require any sign-in to fetch:</p>
<ul>
<li>All US Holidays</li>
<li>First day of each season, dates when the time changes</li>
<li>Special astronomical events like eclipses or visible meteor showers etc (list time of day for these ones, for example &ldquo;Solar Eclipse at 2:11 PM&rdquo; listed on its date</li>
<li>SpaceX launches from Vandenberg ONLY</li>
<li>Anything else you see fit to list here (let me know if you&rsquo;ve added anything when you finish)</li>
</ul>
<p>Come up with theme colors and icons for each foreseeable event (such as a clock for time change days, spaceship for launches, egg for Easter, etc, and fall back to just text for unknown events.</p>
<p>On the left half of the screen, full remaining width (to the left of the square calendar on the right) should be in this order:</p>
<p>Time in the format: 12:42 PM
Date in the format: Nov 23rd</p>
<p>Both of these should have fun, randomized animated transitions. Use whatever html and css tricks you want to do this, just make sure it&rsquo;s all self-contained code and libraries you can include in hockenworks so this thing never breaks.</p>
<p>Then have a few lines which list any upcoming holidays or events in the next 4 weeks verbally in the format: Solar Eclipse coming up next Tuesday, February 17th at 2:11 PM or Solar Eclipse coming up February 17th at 2:11 PM</p>
<p>You should use &ldquo;this&rdquo; and &ldquo;next&rdquo; for upcoming days of the week, or leave part that out if it&rsquo;s further than 2 weeks out.</p>
<p>Do this on a black background with primarily white and light pastel colorings.
New data such as holidays should be fetch hourly, if you need to decide on a frequency.
Remember, this will be permanently displayed and always be up to date so account for any edge cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The combination of <a href="/vision-is-the-last-hurdle-before-agi">AIs really not being able to see yet</a> and also being unable to test on the physical Raspberry Pi device which had some unique properties, Codex simply failed at the visual calendar. So I pivoted to a text-only dashboard.</p>
<p>But here is where I think the term vibe coding should become &ldquo;vibe engineering.&rdquo; Look at that prompt, which was still not nearly detailed enough to produce what I wanted. There were at least ten more prompts, several as long as that, after pivoting to a text-only dashboard to get it working well. This wasn&rsquo;t to correct AI mistakes, but to get to the level of precision in <em>what I actually wanted out of the dashboard</em>. You have to be <strong>SO</strong> precise in your prompting to get what you want. Precise like an engineer, not an idea guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much faster to have AI code for you than to write it yourself. But if you are spending this much time designing detailed logic and building up the knowledge of what is feasible and what isn&rsquo;t, in my opinion, you&rsquo;re an engineer.</p>
<p>The AI also lacks any touchpoints with the real world - in this case, my old chromium running on Raspberry Pi was not testable for the AI, and so I had to run back and forth from my office to the dashboard to see if things scaled correctly. This is not just a problem for niche projects like this. I have seen AI code not work on certain devices and browsers in “normal” web projects at work too, and fixing these things is what <em>engineers</em> do.</p>
<p>And then, potentially the most egregious consistent failure mode (and this really needs to be fixed): AI still loves to mock up fake data. This happened multiple times in this project where AI just started ignoring API calls and making up dates and times for things to happen. This tendency feels like the labs are trying to game benchmarks by making their software agents make plausible-looking successes that a human evaluator might miss and accidentally rate highly - but made up data is far, far worse for real world use, especially for non-engineers who are less likely to catch it.</p>
<p>Even with all of these problems preventing these models from “democratizing engineering” - they are still amazing tools. I would not have known where to start on many of these features without the AI simply knowing things I didn’t, like the open weather API and the method of accessing Google sheets as a CSV export. Even as an engineer, there&rsquo;s no chance I would have whipped up a custom dashboard to do all this and solve my dashboardlessness before the era of AI.</p>
<p>These models are liars and cheats that are also blind, but somehow they’re still greatly expanding what it’s possible to build, and how fast we can build it. Just recognize that once you are building and running real software that actually fits your intentions, you are, effectively, an engineer.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s my most patriotic print yet! I have been using our new (hand-me-down) stroller a lot lately, for obvious reasons, and I decided there were a few things I just couldn&rsquo;t go without.</p>
<p>So, I made a one-print solution that requires zero support and attaches to the handle of any stroller with hose clamps, which are shown here covered by separate printed strap covers to protect the leather of the stroller handle. I&rsquo;ve deemed it the Strollerhock:</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist printing it in my red, white, and blue ABS since its first real test run would be in Coronado, CA for the 4th of July weekend.</p>
<p>The Strollerhock includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A battery holder for a 40K mAh rechargeable battery (about 8 smartphones&rsquo; worth)</li>
<li>A baby fan mount, powered by the battery</li>
<li>Two phone mount positions, both of which can be used while the phone is charging from the battery</li>
<li>A paper or cash clip</li>
<li>A key hook</li>
<li>A pacifier compartment</li>
<li>A multi-width tapered cupholder</li>
</ul>
<p>I may have gone a little overboard on design on this one - probably 8+ hours of design and print prep, but it did come in handy walking all around the island! I am still adding finishing touches, but for anyone interested, here is the first complete versions of the Strollerhock and the clamp cover straps:

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have long been of the mind that LLMs and their evolutions are truly thinking, and that they are on their way to solving all of the intellectual tasks that humans can solve today.</p>
<p>To me, it is just too uncanny that the technology that seems to have made the final jump to some degree of competence in tasks that require what is commonly understood as &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; or &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;, after a long string of attempts and architectures that fail these tasks, is a type of neural network. It would be much easier to argue away transformer models as non-thinking stochastic parrots if we had happened to have had success with any other architecture than the one that was designed to mimic our own brains and the neurons firing off to one another within them. It&rsquo;s just too weird. They are shaped like us, they sound like us in a lot of ways, and it&rsquo;s obvious they are thinking something like us too.</p>
<p>I am not saying they are as good as us yet, though, for a few small reasons and one big one.</p>
<h2 id="the-limitations">The Limitations</h2>
<p>Current frontier &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; models are not AGI in the modern definition. They can&rsquo;t do every task humans can do intellectually (IE without a body, which I will get to) for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Looping/Recursive reasoning:
This was a huge problem for early transformers that had to output in one shot, and the examples were obvious. This one has been essentially solved via thinking models like o1, and now o3, gemini and grok thinking models, and many more. That was a huge unlock and a huge boon for applications like programming where there is lots of nested recursion of logic that has to occur to find a reasonable solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory and context:
Context windows get larger all the time, but this limitation still is not solved. Just adding a bunch of tokens into a context window doesn&rsquo;t get you much when 2 million token models lose coherence after about the first 40,000 - which they do, and which every programmer working with anything but a tiny codebase intuitively understands. But this one too will largely be solved soon, if not through architectures that actually update their weights, it&rsquo;ll be solved through nuanced memory systems that people are actively developing on top of thinking models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size:
This is basic, but most of the models we can interact with today are still working with an order of magnitude fewer neural synapses than human brains. It could very easily be that, even with the other problems solved, we just need bigger electronic brains to match the size of our meat ones. It certainly <em>feels</em> like some of the ways LLMs fail today sort of come down to &ldquo;not enough horsepower&rdquo; types of issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>:
And this one might sound funny to someone that is paying attention to AI in particular, because GPT-4 with vision launched something like 2 years ago now. And it has been impressive for a long time, able to do things like identify what objects are in an image, where an image is from, etc: things most humans can&rsquo;t do glancing at an image, that seem super-human.</p>
<p>But the vision itself is not “good” vision. It cannot really pick out small important details, and it still behaves in many ways like vision recognition models have for years now. Now that we have a model that has both thinking and image input and editing at every step, the o3 and o4-mini series that recently released, we can really start to see the limitations in vision. Let me take you through 2 examples that represent the 2 types of failure modes that result from these not having true image understanding, yet.</p>
<p>My thesis today is that this is the key limitation that is not going to be overcome &ldquo;by default,&rdquo; but that it will be overcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="proof-the-vision-is-not-there-yet">Proof the Vision is Not There Yet</h2>
<p>Each release from the major providers steadily knocks away my intelligence tests, which I admit are mostly programming oriented, but the ones that they can never really dent are the spatial reasoning ones - where a model really has to think about images in its head or use an image provided for detailed work.</p>
<h3 id="simple-3d-modeling-with-frontier-ai-models">Simple 3D Modeling with Frontier AI Models</h3>
<p>Every major model release, <a href="/3d-modeling-with-ai">I test what models can do with OpenSCAD</a>. I won’t get technical about it here, but OpenSCAD is a CAD program (Computer Aided Design - think 3D modeling for engineers, not the artistic kind) that is defined entirely through a programming language vs the typical mouse strokes and key presses that software like SolidWorks or AutoCAD depend on.</p>
<p>This makes OpenSCAD the perfect test platform for a model that inputs and outputs text primarily. I can describe a 3D model I want, and the model can output text that renders into a 3D model.</p>
<p>As amazing as LLMs are at scripting in normal programming languages, they have never been good at OpenSCAD. See my link above for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 trying to model an incredibly simple object. That acorn was about as complex as GPT-4 could get without really falling down.</p>
<p>Here is OpenAI&rsquo;s o3’s attempt to make a standard 2x4 Lego Brick:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="an OpenSCAD render"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/o3-lego.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">o3&#39;s model left, real Lego brick right</span>
    
</div>

<p>This was the easiest object I tested, and o3 does a decently good job. It grabbed the correct dimensions online and, using its inherent training data of what a 2x4 Lego block is, applied those dimensions into a mostly coherent object. It has one major flaw, which you can see on the underside as I have the image rotated - it drew two lines through two of the cylinders. My guess is that this is its interpretation of the supports in the middle of the actual Lego brick, that connect but don&rsquo;t run through the center cylinder.</p>
<p>Now for a harder test: a simple engineering part that&rsquo;s definitely not in its training data, because it is my own design. I printed this for a robotics project more than a decade ago, and had it sitting around in my 3D printer storage drawer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a weird part - a pinion with a smooth section and an 11-tooth gear of equal diameter, and a hole in the center with a slightly raised wall. This is the kind of part that an engineer well versed in AutoCAD or SolidWorks can produce in just a few minutes, but which requires attention to detail and a conceptual model of how parts fit together.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">o3&#39;s model left, real part right</span>
    
</div>

<p>This is where you can see how these models fall apart. o3 immediately gets that it&rsquo;s a pinion, that it has a hole in the middle, and that it has a smooth section on the bottom and a gear on top. But the execution is nowhere close to workable, from most major to least (in my opinion):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two gears (unknown as to why or if this is intentional, o3 explained one as a &ldquo;grooved ring&rdquo; - whatever that means)</li>
<li>The gear teeth are concave - whereas the rounded sharp tooth shape is clear in the image</li>
<li>There are 10 teeth, not eleven - which seems trivial, but it&rsquo;s indicative of a real flaw that messes up all complex models I throw at AI - where LLMs make an assumption like what number of teeth is &ldquo;likely,&rdquo; rather than looking at the image in detail and counting them.</li>
<li>There is clearly an attempt at the raised wall around the top hole, but it&rsquo;s far too big.</li>
<li>The height of the smooth base section and gear sections are equal in the real part, but o3 makes the gear more than 3x thicker than the base.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="map-reading">Map Reading</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another great example of what I mean when I say that frontier models have bad vision.</p>
<p>I recently gave this question to the latest thinking image model, o3: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an image from Google Maps of the block I live on between the avenues of Burbank, Hazeltine, Oxnard, and Van Nuys. What is the longest continuous loop I can walk within the neighborhood without crossing my path or touching one of the avenues? This square is 1/2 mi on each side&rdquo;</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="the uploaded map"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/o3-struggle-map-new.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 400px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The image uploaded with this query</span>
    
</div>

<p>O3 thinks for 4 minutes about this question, zooming in to various parts of the map countless times to form the route. And then it fails on the first step, suggesting starting at Tiara and Stansbury, which do not intersect on the map. Any person looking at this image could tell that is true in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>This is what I mean when I say these things have bad vision - and this is the best model from the lab I think has the best vision. Vision is not about being able to identify millions of different objects, <a href="https://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet-style</a>. It&rsquo;s about seeing the detail and paying attention to the right thing. Here in this map, that means looking roughly at the lines representing Stansbury and Tiara, looking at where they would intersect, and seeing they do not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though getting AI models to read maps and create 3D models from code may not be on everyone&rsquo;s rubric, any UX developer that has worked with a frontier AI knows what I&rsquo;m saying intuitively. This is likely just as true for any role heavily leaning on visual information. There is a difference between generating some Tailwind code that spits out a standard UI and getting to the level of complexity that the AI starts to need to look at screenshots in detail and know the relative position and orientation of components, or see small details. They just.. don&rsquo;t do that yet.</p>
<h3 id="non-frontier-ai-models">Non-Frontier AI Models</h3>
<p>A common retort to this argument might be &ldquo;Well Brian, you&rsquo;re using the wrong type of model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But believe me, I try essentially everything I can get my hands on, and like non-LLM AI models in other domains, other than being incredibly limited in application, these models are simply not good at vision, either. Here&rsquo;s an image of a 3D model generated by Zoo CAD, a company doing text and image to 3D, which was, when I printed it back in January at least, state of the art in this domain:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="My Flipper Zero and 3D Printed Clone"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/flipper-3d.jpg"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">My Flipper Zero (left) and its 3d-printed clone (right)</span>
    
</div>

<p>The input to the model was a picture I took of my <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero hacking toy</a>. The 3D print on the right is of the 3D model it produced, with the only modification on my part being to scale it.</p>
<p>I have long awaited an easy way to &ldquo;3D scan&rdquo; parts from the real world into software. This would make so many of my DIY printing jobs around the house much easier - and it gets us one step closer to the dream of teleportation.</p>
<p>And I was impressed when I first saw this output - it was one of the best of my attempts with this AI tool. Feature-wise, it did a pretty good job of capturing the main facets of my Flipper Zero. But it&rsquo;s just too obviously not good enough: dimensions are all wrong, there is hallucinated symmetry all over the place, and small details are missed everywhere. One of the reasons I printed this model was just to get a real feel for how similar it is to the Flipper when scaled correctly, and it just becomes obvious that this is not a useful technology yet when you hold both of them in your hands.</p>
<p>My prediction is that frontier models will get there before purpose-trained models like the one that cloned my Flipper Zero. This has been the reality across most other domains of AI. Now that we have general-purpose AI models that have started to encapsulate a working, if not complete, conceptual model of the world, they are starting to outperform all of the smaller purpose-built models of the last decade.</p>
<p>And this will be good for the general capability of the AI industry: It&rsquo;s a much better outcome to have a few general-purpose models that can do fine visual work, that can be prompted and orchestrated by people working in different domains, than it is to need an AI lab or startup to train a specific model for every task. It&rsquo;s the same reason I believe humanoid robots are going to win over purpose-built ones in the long run: We can&rsquo;t predict what users will want their robots to do, and our world is built for humans to operate in it - therefore the most capable robots will be shaped generally like humans.</p>
<p>So how will frontier models get good at visual tasks, if they have such bad vision right now? I think the answer to that question also involves humanoids.</p>
<h2 id="the-humanoids">The Humanoids</h2>
<p>What I think is going on in these examples of frontier model vision failures is that we have a limitation in training data (duh!) - but that isn&rsquo;t because there aren&rsquo;t a lot of images and videos on the internet, it&rsquo;s because there is so much more information in the average image than there is in the average chunk of text, and a lot more of that information is irrelevant to any given question.</p>
<p>When I say that we have a limitation on training data, I&rsquo;m not in the typical camp of &ldquo;well, then transformer neural nets are obviously stupid because I was able to understand this thing without training on terabytes of data from the internet&rdquo;. This has always been a bad take because the average human trains on petabytes, not terabytes of data, and that data is streamed into their brains mostly in the form of images. I am also not in the camp of thinking that this means that the data &ldquo;just doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; to get these models to AGI in the visual dimension. It so clearly does exist, and it exists so abundantly that a unique image stream can be sent to each of the billions of human brains, and they all learn the same principles that let them immediately identify the mistake that the cutting-edge thinking vision model made after 4 minutes of rigor.</p>
<p>Not only does the data exist: We never actually had a data problem in AI in the first place. We have an instruction problem. That doesn&rsquo;t mean model architecture or data massaging really, it means that we need to plug our models into the real world where all the data streams exist. I believe this will come first in the form of robots with cameras on them, the first of which is happening en masse via Tesla full self-driving AI, and I&rsquo;m sure those vision neural nets are quite insanely capable compared to what we see in the consumer transformer vision models. But the real leap probably comes when we get to humanoid robots walking around collecting and learning from vision data every day - and learning from actions they take in the real world.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to get concrete actions to take based on a vision-transformer’s outputs, you will know it’s hard. I never posted about it, but I did a small project with a friend a year or two ago, trying to get automated QA working on web software, and we failed in a lot of different ways. I am very impressed that the big labs are starting to crack <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use">computer use</a> - because getting an LLM to give specific coordinates or elements to click on is the same type of challenge I was testing above. But it&rsquo;s no wonder these computer use applications are still very inaccurate.</p>
<p>Letting transformer-based agents control robots will be a much harder problem of a similar type. Not only does it require attention to detail, but now the images are in 3D, they come at you many times per second, and actions need to be produced as quickly. But my prediction is that we will brute force this, and it will work &ldquo;well enough&rdquo; for enthusiasts and niche industrial use cases to benefit from humanoid robots. And that&rsquo;s the takeoff point for true vision, as we all intuitively understand it. Releasing humanoids at scale (and cars, to some extent) are when we really unleash the datastream that&rsquo;s needed to get models that can see as well as you or I can. This is probably one reason why many AI companies and labs are pushing them so hard - they also understand the data they collect will be more valuable than the money paid for the first units.</p>
<p>Once we have a few hundred thousand humanoids roaming around early adopters&rsquo; houses, we will start to see AI models that can use OpenSCAD and Google Maps. And, conveniently, that&rsquo;s also the missing capability that will make the humanoids really useful. We have interesting years ahead of us.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few clones or slight enhancements of games I like before like <a href="/nope-game">Nope</a> and <a href="/hocken-pocket-blokus">Hocken-Pocket-Blokus</a>, but Bloom or Bust is my first attempt at something of my own design with very high production quality.</p>

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The Cast</span>
    
</div>

<p>This is a risk-taking game where players compete to take over a tree with their specific type of fruit. Trees and bees are becoming a recurring theme in my games!</p>
<p>All parts of this game are hand-designed by me, mostly in VR with a tool called Gravity Sketch, blender, and one of my favorite programmer&rsquo;s 3D tools called OpenSCAD.</p>

<p>Of all my models, this one takes most advantage of my multicolor BambuLab printer. All parts including the custom box which cleverly incorporates the instructions and game board itself are printed in BambuLab Matte PLA, which in my opinion is the most beautiful way to print.</p>
<p>Production is batched with 80 to 150 of each fruit or bee on a build plate, with overall production heavily limited by the game board and latching box each requiring a separate print.</p>

<p>I have looked into outsourcing production of this game so that I can actually distribute it, but that has not happened yet. Its design is totally dependent on multicolor 3D printing, and most print farms would require nearly $30 just to produce it, let alone shipping it and any margin. Injection molding is an option but also gets expensive with this level of detailed color, and requires remodeling in several significant ways. It still might happen. Or I might put it out on a site that lets people buy the model and print it themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post in the future about how I decide to distribute this. If you really want to buy one now, contact me - but as of now I need to charge about $100 for a set.</p>

<h2 id="hocken-pocket-blokus-print-instructions">Hocken-Pocket-Blokus Print Instructions</h2>
<p>If you have a multi-filament printer, check out the new 3mf for &ldquo;Hocken Pocket Blokus&rdquo; - a self contained full blokus game and box with a hinged lid, and game instructions printed into the box.</p>
<p>You can also print the lid and box STLs separately, but if you choose to do that, remember: the pocket version that the box and lid are made for requires scaling the board and pieces: X scaled to 70%, Y scaled to 70% and Z scaled to 115%.</p>
<h2 id="original-print-instructions">Original Print Instructions</h2>
<p>To print the board, print 4 of the &ldquo;Playing Board Quarter&rdquo; file. These should have the right level of tolerance to fit snugly but not too tight.</p>
<p>To print the pieces, you can either use the full plate set of 21 pieces, or pick and choose from the individual files. The file names represent the number of squares in each piece, as well as a word description of what the piece looks like.</p>
<p>Make sure the board and all sets of pieces are distinct colors of plastic.</p>

<p>It was super fun returning to this project! I was able to fix a few things that I had noticed failing over the years, like the new reinforced sides to the &ldquo;? Block&rdquo; holder. Now that multi-color prints are proliferating more widely, I&rsquo;m hoping people can use the new colored files - they really pop with the Silk+Matte PLA combo I used here.

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been occasionally challenging GPT to create models using <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, a &ldquo;programming language for 3D models&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both struggle, but GPT-4 has been a massive improvement. Here are both models&rsquo; outputs after asking for an acorn and 3 messages of me giving feedback:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

</div>

<p>For the record, it is impressive that these LLMs can get anything right with no visual input or training on shapes like these. Imagine looking at the programming reference for openSCAD and trying to do this blind. The fact that the 3.5 version has a bunch of strangely intersecting primitives and some union issues has been normal in my experience. It takes quite a bit of spatial logic to get a model not to look like that.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Control Panel</strong> is a hardware project I designed in 2016 to manage home automation systems. The project involved designing a custom 3D-printed case for a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a touchscreen interface.</p>
<p>Links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/RaspberryPiControlPanel">GitHub</a></li>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>I created this panel display in 2016 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification to the software or Pi itself! However, the LED behind the screen died this year and I had to replace it (link below)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>
<h2 id="hahahugoshortcode29s0hbhb">

<p>Feel free to explore the linked repositories for schematics and source code.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>If you want to make this, all you need to do is set up a raspberry pi, download chromium (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to your action tiles panel.</p>
<p>If you want to mount the screen vertically like mine, then I have made an easier solution than going through the trouble of actually rotating the raspberry&rsquo;s display and touch device. Just use the html below and edit it to use your own panel&rsquo;s URL in the &ldquo;iframe&rdquo; element instead of mine. This will launch the panel rotated in your browser.</p>

<p>Play time is about 20 minutes for the 3-5 player version, and 25-30 minutes for the 6-8 player version. Learning how to play the game takes 1-5 minutes depending on the attention span of the players. Have fun!</p>
<p>See Thingiverse for all of the files:

<h1 id="print-instructions">Print Instructions</h1>
<p>3D-Print 88 tokens.</p>
<p>2D-Print the 2 included PDFs back-to-back, so that the numbers appear on the one side and the identical backsides are on the back. Or, leave out the backs as they are not necessary to play the game. Cut 9 cards out of each paper when they&rsquo;re done printing, along the gray lines.</p>
<p>It is recommended to either print on heavy duty paper, or to laminate the resulting cards.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make your own layout with larger or smaller cards using the included zip file of images.</p>
<p>For the 3-5 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 35. For the 6-8 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 46.</p>
<h1 id="to-play">To Play:</h1>
<p>Here is a link to the 3-5 player instructions:
<a href="https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/17/c3/3c-no-thanks-rulebook.pdf">https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/17/c3/3c-no-thanks-rulebook.pdf</a></p>
<p>The 6-8 player instructions are almost exactly the same as the 3-5 player game:
-All players still receive 11 tokens at the beginning of the game.
-Play with the 3-46 deck, shuffle the deck, and remove 11 cards instead of 9 cards before playing.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Printing:
Print in ABS if possible. ABS is dishwasher safe (will not warp) and PLA is not. Print it hot to make it waterproof, if possible. I used .15 mm layers for the top and .25 mm layers for the base, and 30% fill for both. I would highly recommend a layer height of .15 or less for the top part, as there are a lot of small features you don&rsquo;t want your printer glossing over.</p>
<h3 id="assembly">Assembly:</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need some small-gauge wire and pliers to finish the assembly of this thing. I used 28 gauge stainless steel wire, but anything 28 gauge or smaller and waterproof should work. Don&rsquo;t use fishing line because it flexes too much to work. Actual metal wire is needed.</p>
<p>Loop and tie the wire through one of the four mounting holes near the four corners of the top piece. Then weave the rest of the wire through the 20 holes (10 on each side) starting with the one immediately below the mounting hole you started with. Try to keep the wire as tight as possible with each weave. Finish by tying the other end of your wire to the remaining mounting hole on the side you started on.</p>
<p>Your wires are probably not tight enough at this point. Make sure the two ends are tied securely, and then grab your pliers. There is a small, vertical, raised wall with a notch in it between each hole on the outer edge of the top piece. Using the pliers, lift the wire into the notch on as many of the outer wire loops as possible in order to tighten it.</p>
<h3 id="operation">Operation:</h3>
<p>Peel your hard-boiled egg and place it on the base sideways. Push the top piece through the base and the wires. If you want your egg diced, lift it off the base, remove the top pieces of the slicer, put the egg back down rotated 90 degrees and proceed to dice your egg.</p>
<p>Soak in warm soapy water to wash it before storing.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>You will need two 4mm-wide wall hooks (the kind used to mount pictures). Make sure they conduct and are attracted to magnets. You will also need a hot glue gun.
Print two of the attached STL files (one of the mountable variety if you plan to mount it). Flatten the wall hooks with a hammer to get them completely flat, and lay the first one on one of your printed pieces leaving about a half an inch to spare from one end, and hanging out the other. Place a dab of hot glue on the end where it is hanging off. Do the same with the other half, and then place the halves together so the metal pieces are not quite touching in the middle. Seal the metal in place with hot glue.</p>
<p>The hot glue lets the metal move slightly, so that one metal piece bends to touch the other when a magnet is near either side of the switch, completing the circuit between the two metal ends still sticking out.</p>]]></description>
