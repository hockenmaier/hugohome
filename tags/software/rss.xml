                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The advent of general coding AI assistants almost immediately changed how I think about hiring and interviews.</p>
<p>In the software engineering world, this mindset shift was psychologically easy for me, because I&rsquo;ve always had a bias against the types of coding questions that AI can now answer near-perfectly. And they also happen to be the kind of questions I personally do badly at - the ones requiring troves of knowledge or rote memory of specific language capabilities, libraries, and syntax. It is not so psychologically easy for everyone, especially those who have developed a core skill set of running or passing &ldquo;leetcode-style&rdquo; interviews. Even before AI, the only types of coding questions I would personally ask were things that simply evaluate whether a candidate is lying or not about whether they can code at all, which was and still is surprisingly common. I have interviewed people that list bullet points like 7 years of Java experience but can&rsquo;t pass a fizz-buzz like question, and this was a question I gave out on paper with a closed door and no significant time pressure.</p>
<p>So, when LLMs that could remember any syntax or attribute of any programming language perfectly were released, not only was I excited - I immediately saw that a huge chunk of the programming questions I and many I know have asked in interviews were essentially irrelevant now, not only because people could cheat on interviews, at least virtually, but because this knowledge simply lost much of its value overnight.</p>
<p>Over a few conversations with friends and colleagues I began to explore the idea of what this meant generally for the interview process. There are just lots of questions that we ask in every field, it turns out, that are mostly solved by LLMs today. These models have memorized most useful information that lets them ace simple interviewing questions across fields, even if the original intent of the question was to test for experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-build">The Build</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2022 my ideas and conversations on this topic had gotten to the point where I really just needed to test my hypothesis: LLMs and continuous audio transcription could let someone with no knowledge answer many interview questions correctly. My initial thought was that an app like this must already exist. But after searching for apps on the app stores that did what I was thinking of, to my surprise, I found none did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure if this was a legal thing at the time, or if it&rsquo;s hard to get apps that continuously transcribe audio published, but as of 2025 apps like this definitely exist. Some of them have gotten famous and one has gotten its creator expelled from an Ivy League for revealing that he used it to ace interviews with some top tech companies. Link for the curious here:</p>
<p><a href="https://cluely.com/">https://cluely.com/</a></p>
<p>But, in mid 2023, these apps were apparently not a thing, so I decided to make a prototype.</p>
<p>My basic requirements were simply something that could continuously transcribe words being spoken in a meeting or over a call, group them up into meaningfully long chunks, and then send those chunks with some overlap to two different AI passes:</p>
<ol>
<li>An AI pass that would try to make meaningful questions out of the transcribed potential gibberish</li>
<li>An AI pass that would answer those questions</li>
</ol>
<p>My tech stack for this was a little weird, but I know Unity well and I don&rsquo;t know other ways of deploying native mobile apps as well, and this definitely needed to be a mobile app if it was going to sit on the phone and continuously transcribe audio. Web has all kinds of restrictions on its APIs and I hadn&rsquo;t made a web app like this anyways.</p>
<p>This was surprisingly easy to achieve, even in 2023. I ran into a few hiccups mainly around continuous audio transcription, but for an app I wasn&rsquo;t going to publish and that I was directly putting onto my own Android device, I got around these difficulties by simply starting up a new audio transcription thread every time one closed.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Super barebones UI just showing the continuously auto-transcribed words, questions derived from those words, and answers to those questions.  This particular screen was grabbed long after my API key had expired and is only here to show the basic output of the app, transcription building continuously in the background and detected questions and answers in the foreground.</span>
    
</div>

<p>And the results were surprisingly compelling. Of course I was using some of the very first versions of GPT-4 and AI is still not perfect, but the main result of this was that occasionally questions were picked up that were not actually implied by the meeting audio, and occasionally real questions were missed. The part that I knew was going to work did indeed work incredibly well: when I simulated some fizz-buzz style questions and there were no major audio transcription issues, the second question-answering AI nailed them and was able to put a succinct script to answer the question on screen within a few seconds.</p>
<p>There was clearly more work to be done on UI and also the flow between the AI passes, and more agentic APIs of today could definitely do this all more seamlessly.</p>
<p>But for me, my question was answered: My hunch was right and we should definitely not be asking questions about basic constructs of programming languages or simple scripts in interviews anymore.</p>
<p>I open-sourced the project which is a pretty small Unity build, and it&rsquo;s a Unity version from a couple of years ago now, but anyone is welcome to look through and modify the code any way they want:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/make-us-smarter">https://github.com/hockenmaier/make-us-smarter</a></p>
<h2 id="interviewing-mitigations">Interviewing Mitigations</h2>
<p>This whole experience has led me to an interview approach that I think is infallible (for now). And it doesn&rsquo;t require sending someone home with a project or any of the stuff that great candidates often don&rsquo;t even consider. I heard about a version of this technique on Twitter, so can&rsquo;t take credit here:</p>
<p>First: ask candidates to bring some code they have written, regardless of language or framework. Then simply walk through it with them in the interview. asking them questions about why they made certain decisions and trying to guide the conversation to parts that are technically interesting. It only takes 15 minutes or so, and it usually gets much better conversation going than sample interview questions do. This leans on the fact that you need an interviewer who can mostly understand most programming projects, but it cannot be faked with any LLM assistance. LLM-written code is typically pretty obvious: much better commented and differently organized than most humans would write. But even if the code was very sneakily written AI code the person didn&rsquo;t actually contribute to, then having a human go through and explain the parts they thought were clever defeats the purpose of cheating with AI anyway.</p>
<p>This is just a little tidbit of a technique that works well today, if the goal is to assess coding skills. Of course, it leaves some obvious lingering questions about what we are evaluating and why. I hope no one out there that I know is using these apps to cheat on interviews, but we all need to be wise to the fact that it is trivially easy to do so in 2025, and we should shift focus to testing for the qualities that actually matter in the era of AI - or at the very least techniques that prevent the types of cheating possible today.</p>

</div>

<p>Lots of chatter right now about AI replacing software developers.</p>
<p>I agree - AI will take over software development. The question is: what work will be left when this happens?</p>
<p>Some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarks for the best LLMs still put them solidly in the &ldquo;bad at programming&rdquo; category, scoring in the 5th percentile of human programmers on common tests. Meanwhile, LLMs score in the 80th-95th percentile for law exams and 85th–100th for psychology, statistics, and many other less technical fields. More scores available in the &ldquo;simulated exams&rdquo; section of <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">https://openai.com/research/gpt-4</a>.</li>
<li>Engineers have been using language models like tabnine and copilot as &ldquo;super-stackoverflow&rdquo; style code assistance years before chatGPT released. This means much of the velocity increase we might expect from current LLMs&rsquo; ability to write code has already been &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; to the market.</li>
<li>Many of the trends making software development more costly are growing, not shrinking: Systems are becoming more distributed. The cloud lowered infrastructure costs but made applications more complex. We&rsquo;re making more and deeper integrations among disparate systems. Auth is becoming more secure and thus complex (managed identity, MFA, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Github copilot chat and other LLM dev tools are speeding up the rote stuff. I’ve seen it in my own work.</p>
<p>And I really do believe new AI models will do more than just the basics, maybe in the next couple of years. Even precluding &ldquo;AGI&rdquo;, the trend we are on is that more and more work is automatable, and engineers, especially more junior ones - are going to have to shift focus away from algorithmic work that AI can do.</p>
<p>But by the time our neural nets are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; at building software to make it significantly cheaper to build, I doubt this trend will make the news. Everything else gets automated too.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts at what seems to be the beginning of the next AI revolution in early 2024. I plan to revisit this topic and see if I&rsquo;m right in future posts.</p>]]></description>

<p>It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Custom GPT&rdquo; - a customized version of chatGPT. Just give it some details about the API and then tell it in English what you want to get, post, update, whatever.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a PM, business analyst, or anyone that cares about APIs but doesn&rsquo;t like terminals and engineer-y tools like Postman, and you have ChatGPT plus, try it out. Here&rsquo;s a link:

<p>Important disclaimer: DON&rsquo;T use ChatGPT on corporate stuff if your company doesn&rsquo;t allow it! This was a fun experiment for me and I&rsquo;m definitely not using any corporate resources on it/for it. There are plenty of free APIs to try this out on. Maybe ask ChatGPT for some suggestions</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been occasionally challenging GPT to create models using <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, a &ldquo;programming language for 3D models&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both struggle, but GPT-4 has been a massive improvement. Here are both models&rsquo; outputs after asking for an acorn and 3 messages of me giving feedback:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="some weird acorns"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/gpt-acorn.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>For the record, it is impressive that these LLMs can get anything right with no visual input or training on shapes like these. Imagine looking at the programming reference for openSCAD and trying to do this blind. The fact that the 3.5 version has a bunch of strangely intersecting primitives and some union issues has been normal in my experience. It takes quite a bit of spatial logic to get a model not to look like that.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post retrospectively as I never published it at the time of creation. It will live here as a &ldquo;stake in the ground&rdquo; of AI software capabilities as of March 2023. Note- if you&rsquo;re reading on substack, this post won&rsquo;t work. Go to <a href="hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system/">hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system</a>.</p>
<p>The interactive solar system below was created with minimal help from me, by the very first version of GPT-4, before even function calling was a feature. It was the first of an ongoing series of experiments to see what frontier models could do by themselves - and I&rsquo;m posting it here because it was the earliest example I saved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the chat where it was created, though it&rsquo;s not possible to continue this conversation directly since the model involved has long since been deprecated: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387">https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387</a></p>

<div style="width:100%; max-width:1000px; margin:1em auto; position:relative; padding-top:70%;">
  <iframe
    src="/html/solar-system-self-contained.html"
    style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:1px solid #ccc;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">GPT-4 only wrote this for desktop, sorry phone users</span>
    
</div>

<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Click + Drag</kbd> to move the solar system around</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Up</kbd> to zoom in from the cursor location</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd> to zoom out</p>
<p>If you get lost, reload the page. That&rsquo;s an edge case GPT-4 didn&rsquo;t account for :)</p>
<p>Here was the initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be a long output, so if you need to break and I&rsquo;ll ask you to continue in another message feel free to do that. But please limit any non-code text prose to only essential statements to help mitigate this</p>
<p>I want you to make me a dynamic website. It should look good on mobile or on desktop, and I would like you to pick a nice dark background color and an interesting font to use across the page.</p>
<p>The page is intended to show the scale of the solar system in an interactive way, primarily designed for children to zoom in and out of different parts of the solar system and see planets and the Sun in relative scale. Mouse controls should also include panning around the model solar system, and should include text around planets with some statistics about their size, gravity, atmospheres, and any other fun facts you think would be educational and fun for 10-12 year olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I had to give it 4 more short prompts, one for a technical hint (to use html-5 since it was going a strange direction) and 3 for visual and mouse control misses.</p>
<p>It works - but missed some of the relatively simple directions, like the planet stats and rendering/controls for mobile. Still, I think it&rsquo;s cool to see the true scale of the planets on a zoomable canvas. And, it only goes to Neptune, the last true planet&hellip; don&rsquo;t go looking for Pluto.</p>
<p>For March 2023, this result was revolutionary - I was truly impressed. In 2025, it&rsquo;s not very impressive at all. How quickly we get used to progress!</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_radiance_field">neural radiance fields</a> (NeRFs) lately and thought a fun way to explore them would be flying through them in the Treekeepers “Puddle Jumper” in true scale.</p>

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QguH3aK90Ck?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Of course, you lose a lot of the draw of NeRFs when you export the model into a 3d engine because it has to flatten all the textures and lighting, and also Luma AI cuts off 3D model exports as a jarring cube</p>
<p>But still - I was amazed at how well just applying a day/night lighting cycle and mesh colliders worked with this. Projectile and enemy physics played well too.</p>
<p>It’s still early days, but I could see 3D model generation from this tech getting a lot better and forming the basis for some really interesting user-generated content in the future!</p>
<p>Neat stuff - big thanks to Luma AI for the free toolset.</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Control Panel</strong> is a hardware project I designed in 2016 to manage home automation systems. The project involved designing a custom 3D-printed case for a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a touchscreen interface.</p>

<p>I created this panel display in 2016 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>

<p>If you want to make this, all you need to do is set up a raspberry pi, download chromium (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to your action tiles panel.</p>
<p>If you want to mount the screen vertically like mine, then I have made an easier solution than going through the trouble of actually rotating the raspberry&rsquo;s display and touch device. Just use the html below and edit it to use your own panel&rsquo;s URL in the &ldquo;iframe&rdquo; element instead of mine. This will launch the panel rotated in your browser.</p>
