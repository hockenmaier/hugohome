			Lately, my work outside of NBCUniversal has been in VR and AR.  I launched a studio that I named "Together Again Studios" 
			to demonstrate my focus on creating good social experiences in the emerging realm of spacial computing

			I've spent most of my professional career driving a large company towards iterative software projects using small, focused and dedicated engineering teams.  
            I'm a huge proponent of using devops automation, cloud and serverless technologies to reduce development friction and frustration

            At home, I try to practice what I preach and build with an aggressive "minimum viable product" strategy, in technology domains that are sometimes too new 
            or unproven for large enterprises to be pursuing quite yet.  Here is a collection of work I've done outside of Together Again Studios and NBCUniversal

            I've learned that demonstrated skills are far more important than credentials in my personal development and hiring, so this website is focused on real products and teams I've built and led.
