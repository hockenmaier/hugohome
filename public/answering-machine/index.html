Try it here: http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
Github: https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery

It is designed with simplicity in mind — upload any columnar dataset and start asking questions. Advanced NLP algorithms interpret your queries and assumptions, providing answers. You can even correct these assumptions for better follow-up queries.

Features

Upload any dataset: Users can upload columnar datasets (CSV format) and start querying.
Real-time responses: Questions are answered instantly, with NLP driving the interpretation and response generation.
Serverless architecture: The system incurs no hosting costs apart from traffic-based expenses.

<p>On a desktop or tablet, click the link above to navigate to <strong>The Answering Machine</strong>. Currently, it is not optimized for smartphones.</p>
<p>To use the system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Upload a dataset</strong>: Drag and drop a CSV file or use the upload button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example files like &ldquo;HR Activity Sample&rdquo; are available for testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start querying</strong>: Select a dataset and type your question in the query bar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_hr.png" alt="HR dataset view"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use the <strong>information panel</strong> to understand dataset fields, data types, and sample values. This helps formulate more specific questions.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_info.png" alt="Info panel"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="query-types">Query Types</h2>
<p>The system currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counts</strong>: “How many employees joined in 2020?”</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical questions</strong>: Averages, medians, maximums, and minimums.</li>
<li><strong>Filters</strong>: Combine conditions like “What’s the average salary of engineers in 2019?”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="concept-matching">Concept Matching</h2>
<p>If the NLP system misinterprets a query, users can create <strong>concepts</strong> to align query terms with dataset fields.</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_query.png" alt="Answering Machine query bar"></p>
<p>Concepts override the system’s auto-matching logic, ensuring accurate data interpretation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_concept.png" alt="Concept creation"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p><strong>The Answering Machine</strong> is a purely serverless application. Its backend consists of AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway, and other serverless components.</p>

<hr>
<p>Feel free to explore the tool and test various datasets. Remember, this is a proof-of-concept system with no user accounts, so avoid uploading sensitive data.</p>
