            This page details out some of my professional projects pre-2018.
			<br/><br/>
			After the work shown here, I was focussed on spinning up a new "Custom Development Center of Excellence" with the aim of developing more of our applications in-house rather than farming them out to outside talent and offshore firms.  In this role I oversaw the work of 100+ engineers and QA testers both onshore and offshore, but my own focus was spread quite thin, which wasn't sustainable or satisfying for my work style.
			<br/><br/>
			After that period, starting mid-2021, I led the "Rights and Contracts Engineering" team, which comprises a much more manageable group of ~25 software engineers, most of whom I was able to hire directly as full time staff.  This team builds and maintains more than 10 apps involved in creating and managing our company's IP rights data, and has resulted in one major new destination web platform known as AllRights.

                Sphere was an in-house custom software build replacing a legacy AS400-based system.  It was the final piece of the puzzle
                in an organization-wide program called "Request to Billing" which revamped and expedited processes of Studio Lot operations all the way from 
                the first customer request to the final bill issued.

                Creating and internally promoting a new analytics system was one of my first major projects at NBCUniversal.
                The Studio Operations business was one with a tremendous amount of transactional data, but no way to report
                on it in an apples-to-apples way.  My work involved finding the useful data, building the technical
                capability of serving it, and making sure users were happy with the result.

            <div class="content">
                NewsFiles was a drupal-based inventory and order management system that I developed and launched within the NBC News organization in order to track incoming "file ingest" jobs.
                This system replaced a legacy paper-based order management process and helped the News organization move from tape-based to file-based ingest for field news content.
                <br/><br/>
                This system relied on a novel QR-code based ID system that allowed storage devices (hard drives and flash cards) to be tracked, reducing loss and waste.  
                Additionally, QR codes could be scanned with smartphones, triggering dynamic workflows based on the current system status of the device.
