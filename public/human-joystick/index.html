<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Human Joystick&rdquo; solves a common VR problem: providing natural movement in large virtual environments. Players can physically move within a playspace, but once they approach the edge, the system detects the movement vector and shifts the playspace accordingly.</p>
<p>This allows players to explore vast virtual spaces while maintaining immersion and reducing nausea.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>This project was my first VR experience, designed to address virtual movement challenges. Inspired by consumer VR’s limitations in 2016, I aimed to merge physical and artificial locomotion for a more natural experience.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deadzone and active zone</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players remain stationary when in the center (deadzone).</li>
<li>Movement starts when stepping into the active zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjustable speed and direction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed scales with distance from the center.</li>
<li>Supports smooth transitions between directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite achieving basic functionality, there were usability issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recentering difficulty</strong>: Players struggled to naturally return to the center without visual aids.</li>
<li><strong>Directional accuracy</strong>: Switching movement directions without recentralizing was less intuitive than expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>Watch the system in action:</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Though the project remains a prototype, the system demonstrates the potential of combining physical and artificial movement for immersive VR. The code is available for download and experimentation on GitHub.</p>
