<p>I build things, and I develop obsessions with emerging tech especially in VR/AR and NLP/AI.</p>
<p>I’ve been at one company for a long time.  I have led lots of different builds, in lots of different software domains.  Lots of back-office stuff including billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, and most recently some very exciting work building agentic AI systems for the mundane work people at my company have to do!</p>
<p>I love making games, of the video and board varieties.  Those are linked on the left. Below them are some of my favorite posts.</p>
<p>My core bias is to build rather than talk.  Sure - planning is necessary, but I am always the one pushing to just try to build it rather than strategize and plan for months, to scrap things early, and to take risks releasing early.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that accomplishments are far more important than credentials in who I am and who I hire, so most of the posts here are about things I have done by myself or led teams to do, with some occasional essays.</p>

<p><strong>Human Joystick VR</strong> explores a hybrid locomotion system where players move through a virtual environment by physically changing their position within their VR playspace.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Human Joystick&rdquo; solves a common VR problem: providing natural movement in large virtual environments. Players can physically move within a playspace, but once they approach the edge, the system detects the movement vector and shifts the playspace accordingly.</p>

          <p><strong>Raspberry Pi Control Panel</strong> is a hardware project designed to manage home automation systems. The project involved designing a custom 3D-printed case for a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a touchscreen interface.</p>

<p>This project was primarily a hardware initiative. The panel was mounted to a wall and connected to SaaS home automation systems. A custom HTML wrapper was created to control the orientation and settings of the interface.</p>

<p><strong>Land War</strong> is an 8-player real-time-strategy game that combines minimalistic graphics with deep strategic gameplay. Players grow their territories and face off against each other in a battle for dominance.</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The core concept of Land War is an ultra-simplified RTS. Players expand their territories and strategically decide which side of their land to defend or sacrifice when encountering opponents. By leveraging the map structure and coordinating with others, players aim to outlast their opponents.</p>
