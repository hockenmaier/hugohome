      <p>I build things, and I develop obsessions with emerging tech especially in VR/AR and NLP/AI.</p>
<p>I’ve been at one company for a long time.  I have led lots of different builds, in lots of different software domains.  Lots of back-office stuff including billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, and most recently some very exciting work building agentic AI systems for the mundane work people at my company have to do!</p>
<p>My core bias is to build rather than talk.  Sure - planning is necessary, but I am always the one pushing to just try to build it rather than strategize and plan for months, to scrap things early, and to take risks releasing early.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that accomplishments are far more important than credentials in who I am and who I hire, so most of the posts here are about things I have done by myself or led teams to do, with some occasional essays.</p>

<p>Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.</p>
<p>Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the <a href="https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/">Treekeepers VR Website</a> for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.</p>
