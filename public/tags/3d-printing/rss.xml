                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s my most patriotic print yet! I have been using our new (hand-me-down) stroller a lot lately, for obvious reasons, and I decided there were a few things I just couldn&rsquo;t go without.</p>
<p>So, I made a one-print solution that requires zero support and attaches to the handle of any stroller with hose clamps, which are shown here covered by separate printed strap covers to protect the leather of the stroller handle. I&rsquo;ve deemed it the Strollerhock:</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist printing it in my red, white, and blue ABS since its first real test run would be in Coronado, CA for the 4th of July weekend.</p>
<p>The Strollerhock includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A battery holder for a 40K mAh rechargeable battery (about 8 smartphones&rsquo; worth)</li>
<li>A baby fan mount, powered by the battery</li>
<li>Two phone mount positions, both of which can be used while the phone is charging from the battery</li>
<li>A paper or cash clip</li>
<li>A key hook</li>
<li>A pacifier compartment</li>
<li>A multi-width tapered cupholder</li>
</ul>
<p>I may have gone a little overboard on design on this one - probably 8+ hours of design and print prep, but it did come in handy walking all around the island! I am still adding finishing touches, but for anyone interested, here is the first complete versions of the Strollerhock and the clamp cover straps:

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s a peek at my first major board game creation!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few clones or slight enhancements of games I like before like <a href="/nope-game">Nope</a> and <a href="/hocken-pocket-blokus">Hocken-Pocket-Blokus</a>, but Bloom or Bust is my first attempt at something of my own design with very high production quality.</p>

</div>

<p>This is a risk-taking game where players compete to take over a tree with their specific type of fruit. Trees and bees are becoming a recurring theme in my games!</p>
<p>All parts of this game are hand-designed by me, mostly in VR with a tool called Gravity Sketch, blender, and one of my favorite programmer&rsquo;s 3D tools called OpenSCAD.</p>

<p>Of all my models, this one takes most advantage of my multicolor BambuLab printer. All parts including the custom box which cleverly incorporates the instructions and game board itself are printed in BambuLab Matte PLA, which in my opinion is the most beautiful way to print.</p>
<p>Production is batched with 80 to 150 of each fruit or bee on a build plate, with overall production heavily limited by the game board and latching box each requiring a separate print.</p>

<p>I have looked into outsourcing production of this game so that I can actually distribute it, but that has not happened yet. Its design is totally dependent on multicolor 3D printing, and most print farms would require nearly $30 just to produce it, let alone shipping it and any margin. Injection molding is an option but also gets expensive with this level of detailed color, and requires remodeling in several significant ways. It still might happen. Or I might put it out on a site that lets people buy the model and print it themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post in the future about how I decide to distribute this. If you really want to buy one now, contact me - but as of now I need to charge about $100 for a set.</p>

<p>I love small games that travel well, and this game is about the same depth and nearly 1/4th the area of the original box - thus &ldquo;pocket&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a snug fit but nicely sectioned out for all pieces. Have fun!</p>

<h2 id="hocken-pocket-blokus-print-instructions">Hocken-Pocket-Blokus Print Instructions</h2>
<p>If you have a multi-filament printer, check out the new 3mf for &ldquo;Hocken Pocket Blokus&rdquo; - a self contained full blokus game and box with a hinged lid, and game instructions printed into the box.</p>
<p>You can also print the lid and box STLs separately, but if you choose to do that, remember: the pocket version that the box and lid are made for requires scaling the board and pieces: X scaled to 70%, Y scaled to 70% and Z scaled to 115%.</p>
<h2 id="original-print-instructions">Original Print Instructions</h2>
<p>To print the board, print 4 of the &ldquo;Playing Board Quarter&rdquo; file. These should have the right level of tolerance to fit snugly but not too tight.</p>
<p>To print the pieces, you can either use the full plate set of 21 pieces, or pick and choose from the individual files. The file names represent the number of squares in each piece, as well as a word description of what the piece looks like.</p>
<p>Make sure the board and all sets of pieces are distinct colors of plastic.</p>
<p>Here is a link on how to play the game:</p>

<p>It was super fun returning to this project! I was able to fix a few things that I had noticed failing over the years, like the new reinforced sides to the &ldquo;? Block&rdquo; holder. Now that multi-color prints are proliferating more widely, I&rsquo;m hoping people can use the new colored files - they really pop with the Silk+Matte PLA combo I used here.

<p>A demo of the human joystick movement system, showing how the system can work on flat surfaces or terrain.</p>
<p>This was my first barebones VR project. Though I knew Unity going in, VR and 3D games in general have a lot of unique aspects that I wanted to learn about while trying to solve an actual problem, rather than following tutorials or demos online.</p>
<p>VR has some adoption problems in its current state. We all know of some of the main problems- the clunky headset, the nausea issues, and of course the pricetag. But one major problem that you don&rsquo;t really notice until you get into it, is the lack of a good solution for virtual movement.</p>
<p>I had been wondering about &ldquo;the human joystick&rdquo; as a potential a solution to this particular problem ever since getting into consumer VR in 2016.</p>
<p>In most modern VR systems, the player can move physically around the room if they choose. Some applications and games depend on this - they put you in a small space and rely on your physical movement in order to reach different areas and interact with things. But games that provide a more traditional sense of scale and allow players to move through large worlds cannot rely on physical motion, because their users are constrained by physical space. Because of this, you see all kinds of &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; locomotion systems in order to let people move around - some just like traditional 2D games that let users &ldquo;slide&rdquo; their playspaces around the world using a joystick, and others that adopt teleportation mechanics. Neither feel very natural as compared to actually walking, and some can be downright sickening.</p>
<p>My goal with this project was to solve this problem with a mixture of physical and artificial movement.</p>
<p>It works like this: When the player is standing near the center of their playspace, physical VR movement applies. The player can move around and interact with things with their actual bodies. But once the player moves further from the center, the plaspace starts to move with them in the same direction as the vector from the center of the player&rsquo;s space to their current position. This allows for some of the benefits that physical movement experiences have, while allowing the players to more naturally move through an infinite amount of space.</p>
<p>I experimented with several speeds, both static and scaling with the distance between the center and the player. I also experimented with the size of the physical movement &ldquo;deadzone&rdquo; and with vertical and constrained movement across hills, valleys, and buildings.</p>

<p>Eventually I found some good default values and the system worked, but there were some unforeseen problems: First, it was more difficult to center yourself within the playspace without looking at the visible guides I put at the player&rsquo;s feet than I expected. Second and more importantly, when you were already moving in one direction, it was not as simple as I thought to start moving in another direction accurately without fully returning to center, which was an immersion breaker.</p>
<p>Ultimately I put the project up for others to view but have not expanded it into a full experience or released it on any marketplaces. Feel free to download the Unity project and try it on your own VR setup if you&rsquo;re curious.</p>]]></description>

<p>I created this panel display in 2016 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>

<p>If you want to make this, all you need to do is set up a raspberry pi, download chromium (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to your action tiles panel.</p>
<p>If you want to mount the screen vertically like mine, then I have made an easier solution than going through the trouble of actually rotating the raspberry&rsquo;s display and touch device. Just use the html below and edit it to use your own panel&rsquo;s URL in the &ldquo;iframe&rdquo; element instead of mine. This will launch the panel rotated in your browser.</p>

<p>Play time is about 20 minutes for the 3-5 player version, and 25-30 minutes for the 6-8 player version. Learning how to play the game takes 1-5 minutes depending on the attention span of the players. Have fun!</p>

<p>3D-Print 88 tokens.</p>
<p>2D-Print the 2 included PDFs back-to-back, so that the numbers appear on the one side and the identical backsides are on the back. Or, leave out the backs as they are not necessary to play the game. Cut 9 cards out of each paper when they&rsquo;re done printing, along the gray lines.</p>
<p>It is recommended to either print on heavy duty paper, or to laminate the resulting cards.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make your own layout with larger or smaller cards using the included zip file of images.</p>
<p>For the 3-5 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 35. For the 6-8 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 46.</p>

<p>The 6-8 player instructions are almost exactly the same as the 3-5 player game:
-All players still receive 11 tokens at the beginning of the game.
-Play with the 3-46 deck, shuffle the deck, and remove 11 cards instead of 9 cards before playing.</p>]]></description>

    </div>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Printing:
Print in ABS if possible. ABS is dishwasher safe (will not warp) and PLA is not. Print it hot to make it waterproof, if possible. I used .15 mm layers for the top and .25 mm layers for the base, and 30% fill for both. I would highly recommend a layer height of .15 or less for the top part, as there are a lot of small features you don&rsquo;t want your printer glossing over.</p>
<h3 id="assembly">Assembly:</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need some small-gauge wire and pliers to finish the assembly of this thing. I used 28 gauge stainless steel wire, but anything 28 gauge or smaller and waterproof should work. Don&rsquo;t use fishing line because it flexes too much to work. Actual metal wire is needed.</p>
<p>Loop and tie the wire through one of the four mounting holes near the four corners of the top piece. Then weave the rest of the wire through the 20 holes (10 on each side) starting with the one immediately below the mounting hole you started with. Try to keep the wire as tight as possible with each weave. Finish by tying the other end of your wire to the remaining mounting hole on the side you started on.</p>
<p>Your wires are probably not tight enough at this point. Make sure the two ends are tied securely, and then grab your pliers. There is a small, vertical, raised wall with a notch in it between each hole on the outer edge of the top piece. Using the pliers, lift the wire into the notch on as many of the outer wire loops as possible in order to tighten it.</p>
<h3 id="operation">Operation:</h3>
<p>Peel your hard-boiled egg and place it on the base sideways. Push the top piece through the base and the wires. If you want your egg diced, lift it off the base, remove the top pieces of the slicer, put the egg back down rotated 90 degrees and proceed to dice your egg.</p>
<p>Soak in warm soapy water to wash it before storing.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>You will need two 4mm-wide wall hooks (the kind used to mount pictures). Make sure they conduct and are attracted to magnets. You will also need a hot glue gun.
Print two of the attached STL files (one of the mountable variety if you plan to mount it). Flatten the wall hooks with a hammer to get them completely flat, and lay the first one on one of your printed pieces leaving about a half an inch to spare from one end, and hanging out the other. Place a dab of hot glue on the end where it is hanging off. Do the same with the other half, and then place the halves together so the metal pieces are not quite touching in the middle. Seal the metal in place with hot glue.</p>
<p>The hot glue lets the metal move slightly, so that one metal piece bends to touch the other when a magnet is near either side of the switch, completing the circuit between the two metal ends still sticking out.</p>]]></description>
