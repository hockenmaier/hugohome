                    <description><![CDATA[<p>GPT-5, as a text completion model, is not a revelation. In fact, it&rsquo;s more of a disapointment.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t so surprising. It was becoming clearer with every new LLM release that the fundamental improvements from scaling for just the performance of the core text predictor under the hood was starting to taper. But I&rsquo;m going to make an argument today that, although the LLM itself is not nearly as much of a leap from GPT-4 as GPT-4 was from GPT-3, we have still seen at least a full number of real improvement between the release of GPT-4 and GPT-5 as we did between the prior two. And the reason for that is tooling.</p>
<p>Let me start by just illustrating the progress we had made between the first GPT-4 release in early 2023 and the week before the release of GPT-5.</p>
<p>Two years and four months have gone by since I ran my original Interactive Solar System experiment with the original version of GPT-4. You can see that one at <a href="/gpt-4-solar-system">hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at the same test performed a week before the release of GPT-5, which uses ChatGPT Agent Mode. Take a test run:</p>

<style>
  .agent-mode-solar-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: 150%;
    max-width: 1500px;
    margin: 1em 0;
    padding-top: 70%;
  }

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .agent-mode-solar-wrapper {
      width: 100%;
      left: 0;
      transform: none;
      padding-top: 180%;
    }
  }
</style>

<div class="agent-mode-solar-wrapper">

    src="/html/agent-mode-solar-system-self-contained.html"
    style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:1px solid #ccc;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  
    <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Works on desktop or mobile</span>
  
</div>

<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Click + Drag</kbd> to move the solar system around</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Up</kbd> to zoom in from the cursor location</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd> to zoom out</p>
<p>I again used this initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to make me a dynamic website. It should look good on mobile or on desktop, and I would like you to pick a nice dark background color and an interesting font to use across the page.</p>
<p>The page is intended to show the scale of the solar system in an interactive way, primarily designed for children to zoom in and out of different parts of the solar system and see planets and the Sun in relative scale. Mouse controls should also include panning around the model solar system, and should include text around planets with some statistics about their size, gravity, atmospheres, and any other fun facts you think would be educational and fun for 10-12 year olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite an improvement, eh?</p>
<p>Like my original experiment, I didn’t one-shot this result. This is the final result after 7 prompts, but unlike in the original, those prompts were not primarily fixes - they were primarily new features that I thought would be good additions after playing with the previous version.</p>
<p>The most striking part of this experiment for me is that, despite the plateau that has largely been observed in base LLMs, this result is clearly far above and beyond what GPT-4 was able to do when it first released, and the reasons for that have to do with what the labs have been building <em>around</em> the base models.</p>
<p>In the case of Agent mode, as far as we know, we have a GPT-4 class model at the root. o3, which is what Agent Mode uses, is a GPT-4 class model with chain of thought and lots of self-play training.</p>
<p>It also has the ability to use tools, like the web search tool it used to find the planet facts.</p>
<p>But then the thing that most sets it apart from its base model is the deep research and computer use elements of Agent mode. As it was building this model, I saw Agent mode do things such as perusing the internet with its text browser to find scale information and browse for textures it could use as planet skins. Then, the most important new ability that allowed it to make this: It ran this code on a local browser and <em>visually tested it</em>, clicking on the planets to make sure the information panels were coming up, zooming and panning around, and using its own toolbars.</p>
<p>This to me is the start of a true general capability for AI software testing. Not just little unit and automated tests - but actual visual look and feel testing. This is a huge market and will be a huge shock to the software industry when it’s fully realized.</p>

I was surprised to see Scott Alexander&rsquo;s name on this paper, and I was doubly surprised to see him do his <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/scott-daniel">first face reveal podcast about it with Dwarkesh</a>.</p>
<p>On its face, this is one of the most aggressive predictions for when we will have AGI (at least the new definition of AGI, which is something that is comparable to or better than humans at all non-bodily tasks) that I have read. Even as someone who has been a long believer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near">Ray Kurzweil&rsquo;s Singularity predictions</a>, 2027 strikes me as very early. I realize that Kurzweil&rsquo;s AGI date was also late 2020s, which puts his prediction in line with AI 2027, while 2045 was his singularity prediction. But 2027 still feels early to me.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t get into my full take on AI 2027 here, but the core argument comes down to the same one I was making in my <a href="/on-ai-software-development">original post on AI software development</a> - which is that, once AI agents are able to replace software engineers, instead of just assisting them, their current performance in non-software domains doesn&rsquo;t matter. They will simply improve on their own software and training procedures at such a rate that the time difference between the moment of automating software engineering tasks and the moment of automating all other tasks is negligible.</p>
<p>In light of AI 2027, I figured it was a good time to update where AI is actually in terms of software engineering. I&rsquo;ve had the chance to test many of the latest AI software development tools and models, and they have come a long way since my original post. This post is primarily a story of my personal experience with the latest AI coding and &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; tools on a game and web development project.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-built">What I Built</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been developing with AI since 2021, but I got a special chance to really put the latest models and tools to use the last few months while on parental leave. And I have a more valuable type of project with which to accurately evaluate these models on their creative capacity for programming, which is really the hard stuff.</p>
<p>This project is absolutely not in the training data, not even a little bit. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a game built into a website. AI is already much worse at gamedev than other types of development, but it&rsquo;s made extra strange by the fact that the game is built into a CMS website. <a href="/this-website/#ball-machine---the-game">This website!</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very strange project. I won&rsquo;t get too much into the weeds here, but essentially we have a <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo CMS</a> underneath everything, and that Hugo CMS has a bunch of short code that interacts with a bunch of other custom JavaScript that loads dynamically when the player decides to start playing any given page. Just try it on the top right corner of this page and you might start to imagine how weird of an application this would be to work on.</p>
<h1 id="three-ways-for-ai-to-build-your-project">Three Ways for AI to Build Your Project</h1>
<p>Over the course of 5 months, I worked on this game via 3 main methods, which happen to be the main 3 ways that anyone is writing code with AI these days:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chat Assistants</strong> - particularly the o4-mini and o3 models</li>
<li><strong>Automated IDEs</strong> - particularly Cursor</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Coding Agents</strong> - particularly OpenAI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Codex&rdquo;, which launched about 2 months before I finished the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover what they are and how they performed on my game.</p>
<h2 id="chat-assistants">Chat Assistants</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Chat Assistants are models running in a client such as <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F">Claude</a>, or <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Gemini</a>. This often happens on a website, but can happen in other software too - like Github copilot&rsquo;s chat mode in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VScode</a>. The key is that the human is doing all of the input into the AI model and output from the AI response to the codebase. Getting these assistants to write code for you entails passing in instructions and sometimes code context from your project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section is on chat assistants, but it&rsquo;s also a general update on the status of AI code quality today, absent of the wrappers like Cursor and Codex which I will get to later.</p>
<p>Chat assistants are great and have been helping developers for a long time! These are the closest most people get to running LLMs &ldquo;raw&rdquo; rather than through specialized tools designed to limit their errors or make them more agentic. So, you can think of the performance of Chat Assistants for coding as sort of the &ldquo;default performance&rdquo; of AI models to today at coding tasks. The other methods of having AI writing code still have the general performance dynamics I&rsquo;m going to talk about here at their cores, even if they mitigate some types of failures by running their own tests and dealing with console errors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with what might be an obvious statement: LLMs are great at producing simple, low context code. Like - so great that most humans won&rsquo;t need to write much algorithmic logic from here on out. I certainly didn&rsquo;t when making this game, or really anything else I&rsquo;ve made in the last two years.</p>
<p>But basic coding is not all of software engineering, and LLMs still have major issues:</p>
<p><strong>1. They can&rsquo;t deal well with contexts over 30K tokens or so (even the best models with supposedly millions of token context windows).</strong></p>
<p>This means the actual developer (me and you) are typically the ones picking specific files and functions to send into the context window, lest we confuse the model. This is arduous unless the codebase is small enough to fit entirely into the context window. That&rsquo;s exactly what I think is going on with most of the new &ldquo;vibe coded&rdquo; projects we see showing impressive results - these are just tiny POC apps that haven&rsquo;t hit more than a few thousand lines of code yet. For context, most serious enterprise apps containing the detailed logic and edge cases that real use cases require are in the millions or hundreds of millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>This issue is compounded by the fact that the largest labs seem to recognize it, and have modified their chat clients in ways kept secret from the user, to save themselves money. OpenAI in particular implements an invisible, silently failing ~40K token limit on text pasted into the chat window. I know this is the case after many tests where I directly ask models about context that came after the 40K token mark. I have run into many strange issues caused by this, and it’s an insane policy on OpenAI’s part because they have non-invisible text limits for some models like 4o that tell you when your message is too long. My theory on why is pretty insidious if true: They want paying customers to think their very large thinking models will accept their full token limits, and they don’t think many customers will find out they are truncating them for cost reasons anyway, because these models become stupid after 30K tokens.</p>
<p><strong>2. They are biased to be &ldquo;advisors&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;doers&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This is just annoying, and I hope it gets trained out soon, though the second two categories of AI coding tools might obviate fixing this in chat assistants themselves. When they are not specifically trained out of this mindset, most AI models just really <em>want</em> you, the human, to be doing everything, and to act themselves as an advisor. This makes sense with one of the main sources of code training data being from Stackoverflow and other blogs, where developers can never seem to rid themselves of a pseudo-condescending &ldquo;you should have been able to read the docs and learn this yourself&rdquo; tone. It&rsquo;s also just a pattern exhibited by people in general - more often than not, especially in the corporate world, people are incentivized to be the &ldquo;coaches&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;worker bees&rdquo;. One reason why things can get done so slowly in big political companies.</p>
<p><strong>3. They are still wrong at the basics sometimes, but they&rsquo;re wrong MUCH more confidently than human developers.</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the biggest issue for all code produced by AI, regardless of interface. But I&rsquo;m including it in the &ldquo;Chat Assistants&rdquo; section because there are no guardrails on chat assistants other than the human user: they won&rsquo;t run tests and they won&rsquo;t encounter errors. Here&rsquo;s a recent example of a true algorithmic mistake that cost me days of confusion developing my game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function that sets the time interval between physics steps in my game.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code was confidently written by o3, the current best model for coding, after lots of correct &amp; thoughtful discussion about how often we should run physics simulation on my game. 60 hz is a common simulation time, which is Matter.js’s default, but when you have small objects moving around quickly, you need to increase it so that they don’t tunnel through each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tunneling in physics simulations is when one of two objects on a collision course is moving fast enough that there is no single frame where they are colliding, and so they simply pass through each other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all good theory, and o3 also came up with a really thorough chart for this little line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>maxV &gt; 40 ? 8 : maxV &gt; 25 ? 8 : maxV &gt; 12 ? 8 : maxV &gt; 3 ? 8 : 1;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which tried to determine dynamically how many physics steps to run based on how fast objects are moving on the screen. It&rsquo;s a great idea, it is simple algorithmic work, and I was happy not to have to write or think about it.</p>
<p><em>There was just one problem.</em></p>
<p>The condition at the start of this snippet, <em>if (engine.timing.timestamp % 20 === 0)</em>, would never be true, because we are always dividing time up into little chunks in a way that they wouldn’t be whole numbers. The entire code snippet above never runs due to this oversight.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets really hairy, and the confidence issue really compounds in a negative way. I asked o3 and many other AI chatbots and agents about this code, and all “assumed” it was correct and would fire when I told them it wasn’t working. They would dig into all the little minutia of this function, the thresholds, how we were getting the max velocity, etc, and none figured out that why it wasn’t working was something more basic like this.. that it was never firing at all because of the faulty condition that o3 wrote at the top.</p>
<p>To be fair, I, the human, should have caught this before asking yet more AI agents why it wasn’t working. But the AI has taught me to be a little bit lazy, and what does it say about the state of AI independently-written software if multiple passes by state-of-the-art agents didn’t see the issue with a snippet of less than 20 lines of code?</p>
<h2 id="agentic-ides">Agentic IDEs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Automated IDEs are &ldquo;development environments&rdquo;, the software that humans use to write code, with LLM integrations added in to auto-complete or produce new code somewhat agentically. They can do things like read terminal output and attempt to fix their mistakes before you see them. The main examples right now are <a href="https://cursor.com/en">Cursor</a> and <a href="https://windsurf.com/editor">Windsurf</a>. Amazon just launched <a href="https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/">Kiro</a> in this category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After I became a parent and then started having a few hours a day to come up for air, one of the first things I wanted to do was REALLY crack into one of these vibe-coding tools to see what it was all about. I picked <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>.</p>
<p>Simple download, login, install. All going well. The very first feature I decided to throw at it (using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">Claude 3.7</a> which was at the time the top recommended model) was something relatively simple: I wanted to modify the behaviour of the &ldquo;Compactor&rdquo; item in the Ball Machine so that it would not only combine the value of balls, but also remember how many balls had been combined and combine their value growth per second. This would need to change about 3 files and read from maybe 5 more.</p>
<p>The first real disappointment here happened after I entered my detailed prompt for how I wanted this to work: Cursor not only wanted an instruction file explaining how my codebase worked, it also wanted me to <em>manually pick every file</em> to include in the context. I laughed out loud when I saw this. I had been under some impression that Cursor was more than essentially copying and pasting a prompt and some code context into ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I picked all the files I thought were relevant - about 10 of them - and let the agent run. I did this at least three times, testing each one. Some of these runs were many minutes of Claude 3.7 iteratively coding.</p>
<p>Abject failure. Nonsense written into the files. Near total disregard for the context I had provided, outside of some basics like naming and references to real things.</p>
<p>I pressed on for many more attempts, changing the wording of my request, including different files for reference, trying to explain the problem more clearly.</p>
<p>After the final attempt with prompt tweaks and file context tweaks, I just gave up on Cursor doing this. I used <a href="/context-caddy">Context Caddy</a>, my own VScode extension that lets me copy code context from my projects, along with o3, and I got code that worked. Code which I had to tweak and find the right place for. Apparently this was too complicated for Cursor and its top recommended AI model. I was able to achieve simple, mostly one file edits with Cursor using simple natural language prompts. It never seemed to respond well to my multi-pager prompts that I have grown accustomed to giving big thinking models like o3.</p>
<p>In the end, I cannot argue that using a raw LLM via a chat assistant is better than using an automated IDE, but I found them to be similar experiences. There is theoretically nothing that a chat-based LLM could do that Cursor could not, provided you are willing to pay for an expensive model like o3 behind it, prompt it carefully, and correct its mistakes. But I was not willing to do that - the small agentic benefits of Cursor didn&rsquo;t seem worth this cost to me, while already paying for a ChatGPT plus subscription. Perhaps I had been spoiled by Context Caddy.</p>
<p>If you were used to simply plugging in prompts to ChatGPT, then maybe being able to pick files for context combined with a loop that lets the AI model respond to terminal errors could seem like a big upgrade. For me, it was not. The whole experience felt like I was dealing with a typical chat assistant, with a few quirks. This chat assistant has the upside of being able to see errors in the terminal and correct them, but also the downside of directly injecting a bunch of potential AI spam into my codebase without me picking it ahead of time and fixing its mistakes.</p>
<p>After all this, here&rsquo;s my <strong>hottest take of the article</strong>: Automated IDEs like Cursor and Kiro are a fad that will pass us by soon.</p>
<p>They exist today because IDEs are where all code editing takes place, and putting LLMs there was obvious. The next obvious thing was to let them run code and read output from the terminal in a loop. The next most obvious thing is to give them &ldquo;specs&rdquo; instead of prompts, so they have more patterns to follow rather than duplicating code everywhere as LLMs always want to do. This is where we&rsquo;re at with these Agentic IDEs, and they are useful.</p>
<p>But the core issue with this obvious progression of features is that it ignores this fundamental reality: Once AI models are actually good enough to do a software engineering task, there is no reason for that task to happen in an IDE at all, a tool made for humans to write code.</p>
<h2 id="autonomous-coding-agents">Autonomous Coding Agents</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Autonomous Coding Agents, unlike Agentic IDEs, approach the problem of agentic software development without the lens of the toolspace that humans rely on. Using these systems does not depend on the actual code ever living on your own computer. Instead, you give them access to the code in your remote repository such as Github, and they do all the work to clone that code, look through it, make changes, test what they can, and ultimately contribute directly back to that codebase in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control#Pull_requests">Pull Request</a>, or &ldquo;PR&rdquo;. The main two right now are OpenAI&rsquo;s <a href="https://openai.com/codex/">Codex</a> and <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/">Github Copilot Agents</a></p>

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Codex taking a crack at the achievements feature of The Ball Machine</span>
    
</div>

<p>On the face of it, Autonomous Coding Agents aim to do the same thing which has come to be the top feature of Agentic IDEs: They let you specify a feature, change, or fix by simply speaking or typing English, and then they proceed through a loop of coding, evaluating, and refining until they &ldquo;think&rdquo; the feature is done. And both types of system can do that job.</p>
<p>But in my experience with Codex, the Autonomous Coding Agent I used, the difference was night and day.</p>
<p>Codex benefits most from its limitations. It does not sit in an IDE, so it could not possibly ask you, the human, to pick the files to add to system context. It doesn&rsquo;t run on your computer with you watching it, so it needs to handle all of its own looping, eval, and stop logic on its own. It needed to &ldquo;get good&rdquo; at these things. And that it did.</p>
<p>I will just skip straight to the punchline: OpenAI&rsquo;s Codex was writing full new features for my game via my voice-texted prompts alone (most of which I spoke while walking the baby) within days of me setting it up. In fact, the <a href="/this-website/#achievements">entire achievements feature of my game</a>, including the UI components, the logic to detect them, and save them - everything but the images I used for the achievement icon - was created in two Codex PRs generated without me touching the codebase. <a href="https://gist.github.com/hockenmaier/b28ad007f75a1e6a3efbff419ace6589">Full prompt here</a></p>
<p>I had built up to this point a little bit. I started Codex on simple tasks reminiscent of the one I started Cursor on, but I found that I was willing to lend more tasks to Codex, because I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt my work at all. I would just end up with a PR I could review 20 minutes later or so, and if it worked I would merge it. Compare that to the experience with Agentic IDEs, where most of the time you need to open your computer, type up a prompt, select all the context you think is necessary, and then &ldquo;help it along&rdquo; when it gets stuck. This is not to say Codex didn&rsquo;t get stuck - there were things it couldn&rsquo;t do, even the occasional simple thing, but for those I would pull the PR, see that it didn&rsquo;t work, and then just reject it. No longer was I in the world of trying to &ldquo;help along&rdquo; the AI ending up in strange diff states and git stashing to clean up my own workspace. It was just &ldquo;Hey this is a thing the robot could do&rdquo;, then quick voice text, and 20 minutes later 80% of the time a working PR.</p>
<p><strong>But that thought, &ldquo;this is a thing the robot could do&rdquo; is very important</strong></p>
<p>For all the advantages of Codex, it’s still just as bad and generally uncreative as any other AI. And of course that is highly dependent on how standard and boilerplate your code is. Codex is better than any agent I&rsquo;ve used at following a super detailed prompt to completion (The first prompt for that achievements feature is almost two pages long) - but you still need to know your project well enough to write that super detailed prompt. For my game, I just know there are things I could never do with AI. Those involve messing with the fundamental architecture of the code, rethinking gameplay look and feel, or anything with too many moving parts. AI has a limit, and in 2025 that limit is still quite low. It&rsquo;s a junior developer that writes super fast. But I found that when shifting from thinking of AI as an assistant I would proactively try to use vs something I could completely offload half of my tasks to &ldquo;set and forget&rdquo; - the latter is a much more meaningful time savings. It really forced me to draw the line of what could be automated and what the AI could do for me.</p>
<p>There is another nice little benefit to a system that introduces a neat little PR with comments instead of pouring a bunch of code into your active workspace: it immediately puts you into the mindset of &ldquo;I am reviewing this potentially bad code&rdquo;. It forces you to either accept or not. Typically, in &ldquo;assistant land&rdquo; whether that is using chat assistants or things like Cursor, you are going to PR the code yourself. You won&rsquo;t be distinctly &ldquo;reviewing it&rdquo; like a Codex PR, and to other humans it will appear as your work.</p>
<p>I like Codex. A lot. It&rsquo;s more fun to use than something like Cursor and lets me focus on the things I need to. I believe this type of system is where automated software development is going, long term.</p>
<h1 id="tldr-and-what-comes-next">TLDR and What Comes Next</h1>
<p>There is a common pattern when people talk about AI in their own field vs other fields: AI seems revolutionary in fields you don&rsquo;t understand deeply, and less so in your own - because you see the nuance of the errors it makes. I have seen <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089">this study</a> referenced by several engineers in the past few weeks as solid evidence that AI coding is just hype. It makes the core claim that AI is <em>reducing</em> engineering productivity rather than enhancing it, by 20%.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t totally buy this paper. Measuring productivity like this is riddled with issues arising from the basic fact that trying to make engineers use AI often results in the same kind of misuse that you might expect if you asked a bunch of artists to use Midjourney to do their jobs.</p>
<p>But that is not all that&rsquo;s going on. A big part of it, too, is that no matter the paradigm, the underlying AI of 2025 is just <em>not smart enough</em> for most difficult coding tasks. This is especially true in large existing codebases where AI models must use existing classes and refactor existing code rather than just whipping up 300 new lines of code every time.</p>
<p>There is the big stumbling block most people have in evaluating AI: They see a success or they see a failure, they aren&rsquo;t sure how much &ldquo;help&rdquo; the AI received from a human in the cases of success, and they fall back to their biases for how useful or useless they already thought AI was in this domain. Their priors are not updated by these examples.</p>
<p>But now, with the advent of Autonomous Coding Agents (keep in mind, these only started to be a thing a few months ago), software engineers have a clearer view into <em>actually how much</em> of their work can be truly automated. That&rsquo;s because systems like Codex are &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; in some sense. They PR working code or they don&rsquo;t - and there is much less space to get caught up in &ldquo;helping&rdquo; the AI in a task it really didn&rsquo;t have the smarts to do on its own.</p>
<p>Right now, about half of the things I typically set out to do on a project like this game are achievable via Codex. This is mostly small stuff that can be done changing only 1-3 files. But it can be some larger features too, like my achievements system, which don&rsquo;t require thinking hard about the architecture of the application or changing things really significantly. Adding achievements on top of my working game was a sort of perfect example of a high output but low context task that Codex could achieve. This all means there&rsquo;s still a long way to go: the long tail of low complexity work in software engineering is what Codex can already pick up, and the hard stuff is left.</p>
<p>But now that AI is working &ldquo;independently&rdquo;, instead of humans always subtly correcting it when they choose what to paste in from a chat assistant, or when they clean up sloppy Cursor code, that threshold of &ldquo;AI achievable&rdquo; is much clearer. If it&rsquo;s at 50% now, we&rsquo;ll see it tick up to 60%, then 70%, and so on.</p>
<p>I still hold this to be true, as do the authors of AI 2027: when something like Codex is at 100%, the world has entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion">intelligence explosion</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>And yes, I did pick the game from my favorite series that happens to be about miniature people as the first game my miniature daughter Alice would hear.</p>
<p>Most of these are indie titles, but the one I spent the most time on was the Oblivion Remaster - one which surprised me both with how good it looks and with how well it played. Oblivion is a 19 year old game, and a purely graphics-related overhaul should not have made it as good or better than modern AAA games releasing today, but in my opinion (and many others I’m reading) it absolutely did. How could this be?</p>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<p>Well - I think that’s pretty clear. The only thing that has really improved about mainstream gaming in the last 20 years is graphics.</p>
<p>And boy have the graphics improved. Oblivion not only uses new techniques like ray-tracing and revamped 4K textures and normal maps etc, it uses the full suite of global illumination provided by <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-global-illumination-and-reflections-in-unreal-engine">Unreal Engine</a>, which means when you turn the settings up, it depends on hardly any of the typical tricks games need to use, like baked light maps, instead lighting almost everything in the game dynamically or “procedurally”, including things like reflections of reflections and lit up dust and fog.</p>
<p>
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbd00XaK1so?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<em>This is from my playthrough, some outdoor torches in Bruma and mountain lighting in the background make for a pretty good use of full Lumen</em></p>
<p>Yes, Oblivion still has some simplistic design in terms of how landscapes are laid out, but that simplicity might also be why people can run it with Unreal&rsquo;s Lumen set up to run at ultra. Lighting is what’s really differentiating in video game graphics now, and fully simulated lighting beats or meets nearly every AAA game releasing lately that all cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to make.</p>
<h2 id="not-graphics">Not Graphics</h2>
<p>Left unstated is why nothing else has improved. Walking around Oblivion, meeting characters that have some scripted voice lines, responding to them with 1 of 4 options, holding down the left stick to sprint, and hitting a single button on your controller to watch your character animate a full scripted sword swing are all the standard gameplay of action-RPGs both 19 years ago and today. The same can be said of other genres - mechanics are largely untouched for the last 20 years outside of some common quality of life changes in how menus and inventory and HUDs work.</p>
<p>Here’s my theory for why: The games industry achieved the threshold of what was comfortable and possible with the current human-computer input and output mechanisms only a few years after they were technically possible. And those inputs and outputs have not changed much since the 90s. Looking at a flat screen in front of you and pressing buttons on a controller or keyboard/mouse is incredibly limiting for gaming. Increasing the amount of pixels on the screen and making that controller wireless don&rsquo;t change the core gameplay. This is not really true for any other media than games. Reading, watching films, and all kinds of media in between essentially max out on one screen and limited input, but games immediately ran into forms of input and output as a barrier.</p>
<p>I wrote a little about this topic in <a href="/social-media-is-antisocial">my first post about VR and why I think it’s the future</a>. The only true innovation in gameplay that is happening in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indie, where one-man teams can come up with strange mashups and mechanics can execute on a vision spending very little. These are almost never totally genre defining, but they are inventive.</li>
<li>VR, where we have only scratched the surface of mechanics that work and what is possible when the player’s entire hands and 3D field of view are in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>AAA game developers are excluded from the first by definition and are excluded from the second by their own financial decision makers.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-my-predictions">So What? My predictions</h2>
<p>Maybe people want to keep buying the same games with better graphics forever. I don’t think they do. I think those decision makers that aren’t investing in truly new AAA gameplay are short sighted. As long as we’ve been hearing that VR is the future and not seeing it totally come to fruition, at some point these companies that are milking the same game franchises for years will face the reality that people will only buy the same games reskinned with better graphics for so long. They’ll either be replaced by companies that innovate or individuals using AI that will be plenty good at recreating the same game over and over again.</p>
<p>I am hoping that the current hypestorm around AI re-kindles the ideas in the hearts of AAA game studio CFOs that they might need to invest in innovation and new ideas again. Some of the things that make Oblivion just like any RPG of today (Think about the four-option scripted discourse and stuffy voice lines as two) would be meaningfully different if AI was applied in the right way. And I think they’d be far more powerful experiences, just like I think VR games can be - so much higher fidelity and responsive to player input.</p>
<p>Here are my predictions of things we’ll see in the next decade or so, whether or not AAA studios are the ones to pioneer them:</p>
<p>A decade or two from now, we will look at the period of 2005 to 2025 and see that it was a period of a great stagnation in game innovation. This will be driven by a few key technological advances and the downstream game mechanics that will flow from those, stemming mainly from the areas of AI and what is now called mixed reality.</p>
<p>I’m going to make a few specific predictions of mechanics we will see in the future that will make the stagnation of the last 20 years totally transparent:</p>
<h4 id="ai">AI:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In open world games, it will become standard for non-player characters to have fully generated dialogues based on motivations and incentives rather than scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In open world games, players will speak directly or engage directly in some way with their own words that NPCs will understand and react to intelligently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NPCs won&rsquo;t have recorded voice lines, but will instead have voices generated in real time, and AAA games will start to make contracts with celebrity talent in order to generate their voice in games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will see a transition from the current minorly procedural elements of gameplay to full procedural generated worlds, especially where player actions and environmental events change landscape, buildings, etc dynamically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game art will go through an incredible revolution, and we will stop having massive teams of people creating 3D meshes and textures to drop around the world, with many of these meshes and textures being generated from prompts in development, but also being generated on the fly in games</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mixed-reality">Mixed Reality:</h4>
<p>The first reasonable augmented reality glasses that consumers are willing to wear en masse will generate entirely new genres:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new genre of video board games, where gameplay happens in view of a group of people in the same physical space, on a table, on the ground, in a park, etc, that will incorporate video game elements such as computations that are too complicated for typical board games, with the advantages that board games have today where players can interact with the same physical pieces, point and gesture, and socialize in person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another new genre of exercise programs combined with games. This will go far beyond current treadmills that have built-in virtual run routes or virtual exercise classes, this will be exercise incorporated as a leveling or other mechanic that will incentivize players to get some exercise. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of hope for this category for a long time, and the one major threat to it is GLP-1 drugs that may cause a serious decline in the need and desire for people to exercise daily for calorie loss</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When will these happen? My specific prediction is that the next 3 years will be seen as the end of the period of stagnation we are in right now, a period that will be much more apparent looking backwards than it is from within. The combo of a decline in AAA game spending and AI hype feels like ripe conditions for innovation to return to gameplay - and my hope is that all of the other potential gameplay innovations ride the same AI wave.</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The advent of general coding AI assistants almost immediately changed how I think about hiring and interviews.</p>
<p>In the software engineering world, this mindset shift was psychologically easy for me, because I&rsquo;ve always had a bias against the types of coding questions that AI can now answer near-perfectly. And they also happen to be the kind of questions I personally do badly at - the ones requiring troves of knowledge or rote memory of specific language capabilities, libraries, and syntax. It is not so psychologically easy for everyone, especially those who have developed a core skill set of running or passing &ldquo;leetcode-style&rdquo; interviews. Even before AI, the only types of coding questions I would personally ask were things that simply evaluate whether a candidate is lying or not about whether they can code at all, which was and still is surprisingly common. I have interviewed people that list bullet points like 7 years of Java experience but can&rsquo;t pass a fizz-buzz like question, and this was a question I gave out on paper with a closed door and no significant time pressure.</p>
<p>So, when LLMs that could remember any syntax or attribute of any programming language perfectly were released, not only was I excited - I immediately saw that a huge chunk of the programming questions I and many I know have asked in interviews were essentially irrelevant now, not only because people could cheat on interviews, at least virtually, but because this knowledge simply lost much of its value overnight.</p>
<p>Over a few conversations with friends and colleagues I began to explore the idea of what this meant generally for the interview process. There are just lots of questions that we ask in every field, it turns out, that are mostly solved by LLMs today. These models have memorized most useful information that lets them ace simple interviewing questions across fields, even if the original intent of the question was to test for experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-build">The Build</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2022 my ideas and conversations on this topic had gotten to the point where I really just needed to test my hypothesis: LLMs and continuous audio transcription could let someone with no knowledge answer many interview questions correctly. My initial thought was that an app like this must already exist. But after searching for apps on the app stores that did what I was thinking of, to my surprise, I found none did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure if this was a legal thing at the time, or if it&rsquo;s hard to get apps that continuously transcribe audio published, but as of 2025 apps like this definitely exist. Some of them have gotten famous and one has gotten its creator expelled from an Ivy League for revealing that he used it to ace interviews with some top tech companies. Link for the curious here:</p>
<p><a href="https://cluely.com/">https://cluely.com/</a></p>
<p>But, in mid 2023, these apps were apparently not a thing, so I decided to make a prototype.</p>
<p>My basic requirements were simply something that could continuously transcribe words being spoken in a meeting or over a call, group them up into meaningfully long chunks, and then send those chunks with some overlap to two different AI passes:</p>
<ol>
<li>An AI pass that would try to make meaningful questions out of the transcribed potential gibberish</li>
<li>An AI pass that would answer those questions</li>
</ol>
<p>My tech stack for this was a little weird, but I know Unity well and I don&rsquo;t know other ways of deploying native mobile apps as well, and this definitely needed to be a mobile app if it was going to sit on the phone and continuously transcribe audio. Web has all kinds of restrictions on its APIs and I hadn&rsquo;t made a web app like this anyways.</p>
<p>This was surprisingly easy to achieve, even in 2023. I ran into a few hiccups mainly around continuous audio transcription, but for an app I wasn&rsquo;t going to publish and that I was directly putting onto my own Android device, I got around these difficulties by simply starting up a new audio transcription thread every time one closed.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    







    



    























<img  alt="the UI"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/make-us-smarter.jpg"   style="height: auto; max-width: 200px"   >


    
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Super barebones UI just showing the continuously auto-transcribed words, questions derived from those words, and answers to those questions.  This particular screen was grabbed long after my API key had expired and is only here to show the basic output of the app, transcription building continuously in the background and detected questions and answers in the foreground.</span>
    
</div>

<p>And the results were surprisingly compelling. Of course I was using some of the very first versions of GPT-4 and AI is still not perfect, but the main result of this was that occasionally questions were picked up that were not actually implied by the meeting audio, and occasionally real questions were missed. The part that I knew was going to work did indeed work incredibly well: when I simulated some fizz-buzz style questions and there were no major audio transcription issues, the second question-answering AI nailed them and was able to put a succinct script to answer the question on screen within a few seconds.</p>
<p>There was clearly more work to be done on UI and also the flow between the AI passes, and more agentic APIs of today could definitely do this all more seamlessly.</p>
<p>But for me, my question was answered: My hunch was right and we should definitely not be asking questions about basic constructs of programming languages or simple scripts in interviews anymore.</p>
<p>I open-sourced the project which is a pretty small Unity build, and it&rsquo;s a Unity version from a couple of years ago now, but anyone is welcome to look through and modify the code any way they want:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/make-us-smarter">https://github.com/hockenmaier/make-us-smarter</a></p>
<h2 id="interviewing-mitigations">Interviewing Mitigations</h2>
<p>This whole experience has led me to an interview approach that I think is infallible (for now). And it doesn&rsquo;t require sending someone home with a project or any of the stuff that great candidates often don&rsquo;t even consider. I heard about a version of this technique on Twitter, so can&rsquo;t take credit here:</p>
<p>First: ask candidates to bring some code they have written, regardless of language or framework. Then simply walk through it with them in the interview. asking them questions about why they made certain decisions and trying to guide the conversation to parts that are technically interesting. It only takes 15 minutes or so, and it usually gets much better conversation going than sample interview questions do. This leans on the fact that you need an interviewer who can mostly understand most programming projects, but it cannot be faked with any LLM assistance. LLM-written code is typically pretty obvious: much better commented and differently organized than most humans would write. But even if the code was very sneakily written AI code the person didn&rsquo;t actually contribute to, then having a human go through and explain the parts they thought were clever defeats the purpose of cheating with AI anyway.</p>
<p>This is just a little tidbit of a technique that works well today, if the goal is to assess coding skills. Of course, it leaves some obvious lingering questions about what we are evaluating and why. I hope no one out there that I know is using these apps to cheat on interviews, but we all need to be wise to the fact that it is trivially easy to do so in 2025, and we should shift focus to testing for the qualities that actually matter in the era of AI - or at the very least techniques that prevent the types of cheating possible today.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have long been of the mind that LLMs and their evolutions are truly thinking, and that they are on their way to solving all of the intellectual tasks that humans can solve today.</p>
<p>To me, it is just too uncanny that the technology that seems to have made the final jump to some degree of competence in tasks that require what is commonly understood as &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; or &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;, after a long string of attempts and architectures that fail these tasks, is a type of neural network. It would be much easier to argue away transformer models as non-thinking stochastic parrots if we had happened to have had success with any other architecture than the one that was designed to mimic our own brains and the neurons firing off to one another within them. It&rsquo;s just too weird. They are shaped like us, they sound like us in a lot of ways, and it&rsquo;s obvious they are thinking something like us too.</p>
<p>I am not saying they are as good as us yet, though, for a few small reasons and one big one.</p>
<h2 id="the-limitations">The Limitations</h2>
<p>Current frontier &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; models are not AGI in the modern definition. They can&rsquo;t do every task humans can do intellectually (IE without a body, which I will get to) for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Looping/Recursive reasoning:
This was a huge problem for early transformers that had to output in one shot, and the examples were obvious. This one has been essentially solved via thinking models like o1, and now o3, gemini and grok thinking models, and many more. That was a huge unlock and a huge boon for applications like programming where there is lots of nested recursion of logic that has to occur to find a reasonable solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory and context:
Context windows get larger all the time, but this limitation still is not solved. Just adding a bunch of tokens into a context window doesn&rsquo;t get you much when 2 million token models lose coherence after about the first 40,000 - which they do, and which every programmer working with anything but a tiny codebase intuitively understands. But this one too will largely be solved soon, if not through architectures that actually update their weights, it&rsquo;ll be solved through nuanced memory systems that people are actively developing on top of thinking models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size:
This is basic, but most of the models we can interact with today are still working with an order of magnitude fewer neural synapses than human brains. It could very easily be that, even with the other problems solved, we just need bigger electronic brains to match the size of our meat ones. It certainly <em>feels</em> like some of the ways LLMs fail today sort of come down to &ldquo;not enough horsepower&rdquo; types of issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>:
And this one might sound funny to someone that is paying attention to AI in particular, because GPT-4 with vision launched something like 2 years ago now. And it has been impressive for a long time, able to do things like identify what objects are in an image, where an image is from, etc: things most humans can&rsquo;t do glancing at an image, that seem super-human.</p>
<p>But the vision itself is not “good” vision. It cannot really pick out small important details, and it still behaves in many ways like vision recognition models have for years now. Now that we have a model that has both thinking and image input and editing at every step, the o3 and o4-mini series that recently released, we can really start to see the limitations in vision. Let me take you through 2 examples that represent the 2 types of failure modes that result from these not having true image understanding, yet.</p>
<p>My thesis today is that this is the key limitation that is not going to be overcome &ldquo;by default,&rdquo; but that it will be overcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="proof-the-vision-is-not-there-yet">Proof the Vision is Not There Yet</h2>
<p>Each release from the major providers steadily knocks away my intelligence tests, which I admit are mostly programming oriented, but the ones that they can never really dent are the spatial reasoning ones - where a model really has to think about images in its head or use an image provided for detailed work.</p>
<h3 id="simple-3d-modeling-with-frontier-ai-models">Simple 3D Modeling with Frontier AI Models</h3>
<p>Every major model release, <a href="/3d-modeling-with-ai">I test what models can do with OpenSCAD</a>. I won’t get technical about it here, but OpenSCAD is a CAD program (Computer Aided Design - think 3D modeling for engineers, not the artistic kind) that is defined entirely through a programming language vs the typical mouse strokes and key presses that software like SolidWorks or AutoCAD depend on.</p>
<p>This makes OpenSCAD the perfect test platform for a model that inputs and outputs text primarily. I can describe a 3D model I want, and the model can output text that renders into a 3D model.</p>
<p>As amazing as LLMs are at scripting in normal programming languages, they have never been good at OpenSCAD. See my link above for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 trying to model an incredibly simple object. That acorn was about as complex as GPT-4 could get without really falling down.</p>
<p>Here is OpenAI&rsquo;s o3’s attempt to make a standard 2x4 Lego Brick:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="an OpenSCAD render"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/o3-lego.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">o3&#39;s model left, real Lego brick right</span>
    
</div>

<p>This was the easiest object I tested, and o3 does a decently good job. It grabbed the correct dimensions online and, using its inherent training data of what a 2x4 Lego block is, applied those dimensions into a mostly coherent object. It has one major flaw, which you can see on the underside as I have the image rotated - it drew two lines through two of the cylinders. My guess is that this is its interpretation of the supports in the middle of the actual Lego brick, that connect but don&rsquo;t run through the center cylinder.</p>
<p>Now for a harder test: a simple engineering part that&rsquo;s definitely not in its training data, because it is my own design. I printed this for a robotics project more than a decade ago, and had it sitting around in my 3D printer storage drawer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a weird part - a pinion with a smooth section and an 11-tooth gear of equal diameter, and a hole in the center with a slightly raised wall. This is the kind of part that an engineer well versed in AutoCAD or SolidWorks can produce in just a few minutes, but which requires attention to detail and a conceptual model of how parts fit together.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="an OpenSCAD render"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/o3-pinion.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">o3&#39;s model left, real part right</span>
    
</div>

<p>This is where you can see how these models fall apart. o3 immediately gets that it&rsquo;s a pinion, that it has a hole in the middle, and that it has a smooth section on the bottom and a gear on top. But the execution is nowhere close to workable, from most major to least (in my opinion):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two gears (unknown as to why or if this is intentional, o3 explained one as a &ldquo;grooved ring&rdquo; - whatever that means)</li>
<li>The gear teeth are concave - whereas the rounded sharp tooth shape is clear in the image</li>
<li>There are 10 teeth, not eleven - which seems trivial, but it&rsquo;s indicative of a real flaw that messes up all complex models I throw at AI - where LLMs make an assumption like what number of teeth is &ldquo;likely,&rdquo; rather than looking at the image in detail and counting them.</li>
<li>There is clearly an attempt at the raised wall around the top hole, but it&rsquo;s far too big.</li>
<li>The height of the smooth base section and gear sections are equal in the real part, but o3 makes the gear more than 3x thicker than the base.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="map-reading">Map Reading</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another great example of what I mean when I say that frontier models have bad vision.</p>
<p>I recently gave this question to the latest thinking image model, o3: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an image from Google Maps of the block I live on between the avenues of Burbank, Hazeltine, Oxnard, and Van Nuys. What is the longest continuous loop I can walk within the neighborhood without crossing my path or touching one of the avenues? This square is 1/2 mi on each side&rdquo;</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="the uploaded map"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/o3-struggle-map-new.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 400px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The image uploaded with this query</span>
    
</div>

<p>O3 thinks for 4 minutes about this question, zooming in to various parts of the map countless times to form the route. And then it fails on the first step, suggesting starting at Tiara and Stansbury, which do not intersect on the map. Any person looking at this image could tell that is true in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>This is what I mean when I say these things have bad vision - and this is the best model from the lab I think has the best vision. Vision is not about being able to identify millions of different objects, <a href="https://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet-style</a>. It&rsquo;s about seeing the detail and paying attention to the right thing. Here in this map, that means looking roughly at the lines representing Stansbury and Tiara, looking at where they would intersect, and seeing they do not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though getting AI models to read maps and create 3D models from code may not be on everyone&rsquo;s rubric, any UX developer that has worked with a frontier AI knows what I&rsquo;m saying intuitively. This is likely just as true for any role heavily leaning on visual information. There is a difference between generating some Tailwind code that spits out a standard UI and getting to the level of complexity that the AI starts to need to look at screenshots in detail and know the relative position and orientation of components, or see small details. They just.. don&rsquo;t do that yet.</p>
<h3 id="non-frontier-ai-models">Non-Frontier AI Models</h3>
<p>A common retort to this argument might be &ldquo;Well Brian, you&rsquo;re using the wrong type of model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But believe me, I try essentially everything I can get my hands on, and like non-LLM AI models in other domains, other than being incredibly limited in application, these models are simply not good at vision, either. Here&rsquo;s an image of a 3D model generated by Zoo CAD, a company doing text and image to 3D, which was, when I printed it back in January at least, state of the art in this domain:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="My Flipper Zero and 3D Printed Clone"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/flipper-3d.jpg"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">My Flipper Zero (left) and its 3d-printed clone (right)</span>
    
</div>

<p>The input to the model was a picture I took of my <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero hacking toy</a>. The 3D print on the right is of the 3D model it produced, with the only modification on my part being to scale it.</p>
<p>I have long awaited an easy way to &ldquo;3D scan&rdquo; parts from the real world into software. This would make so many of my DIY printing jobs around the house much easier - and it gets us one step closer to the dream of teleportation.</p>
<p>And I was impressed when I first saw this output - it was one of the best of my attempts with this AI tool. Feature-wise, it did a pretty good job of capturing the main facets of my Flipper Zero. But it&rsquo;s just too obviously not good enough: dimensions are all wrong, there is hallucinated symmetry all over the place, and small details are missed everywhere. One of the reasons I printed this model was just to get a real feel for how similar it is to the Flipper when scaled correctly, and it just becomes obvious that this is not a useful technology yet when you hold both of them in your hands.</p>
<p>My prediction is that frontier models will get there before purpose-trained models like the one that cloned my Flipper Zero. This has been the reality across most other domains of AI. Now that we have general-purpose AI models that have started to encapsulate a working, if not complete, conceptual model of the world, they are starting to outperform all of the smaller purpose-built models of the last decade.</p>
<p>And this will be good for the general capability of the AI industry: It&rsquo;s a much better outcome to have a few general-purpose models that can do fine visual work, that can be prompted and orchestrated by people working in different domains, than it is to need an AI lab or startup to train a specific model for every task. It&rsquo;s the same reason I believe humanoid robots are going to win over purpose-built ones in the long run: We can&rsquo;t predict what users will want their robots to do, and our world is built for humans to operate in it - therefore the most capable robots will be shaped generally like humans.</p>
<p>So how will frontier models get good at visual tasks, if they have such bad vision right now? I think the answer to that question also involves humanoids.</p>
<h2 id="the-humanoids">The Humanoids</h2>
<p>What I think is going on in these examples of frontier model vision failures is that we have a limitation in training data (duh!) - but that isn&rsquo;t because there aren&rsquo;t a lot of images and videos on the internet, it&rsquo;s because there is so much more information in the average image than there is in the average chunk of text, and a lot more of that information is irrelevant to any given question.</p>
<p>When I say that we have a limitation on training data, I&rsquo;m not in the typical camp of &ldquo;well, then transformer neural nets are obviously stupid because I was able to understand this thing without training on terabytes of data from the internet&rdquo;. This has always been a bad take because the average human trains on petabytes, not terabytes of data, and that data is streamed into their brains mostly in the form of images. I am also not in the camp of thinking that this means that the data &ldquo;just doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; to get these models to AGI in the visual dimension. It so clearly does exist, and it exists so abundantly that a unique image stream can be sent to each of the billions of human brains, and they all learn the same principles that let them immediately identify the mistake that the cutting-edge thinking vision model made after 4 minutes of rigor.</p>
<p>Not only does the data exist: We never actually had a data problem in AI in the first place. We have an instruction problem. That doesn&rsquo;t mean model architecture or data massaging really, it means that we need to plug our models into the real world where all the data streams exist. I believe this will come first in the form of robots with cameras on them, the first of which is happening en masse via Tesla full self-driving AI, and I&rsquo;m sure those vision neural nets are quite insanely capable compared to what we see in the consumer transformer vision models. But the real leap probably comes when we get to humanoid robots walking around collecting and learning from vision data every day - and learning from actions they take in the real world.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to get concrete actions to take based on a vision-transformer’s outputs, you will know it’s hard. I never posted about it, but I did a small project with a friend a year or two ago, trying to get automated QA working on web software, and we failed in a lot of different ways. I am very impressed that the big labs are starting to crack <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use">computer use</a> - because getting an LLM to give specific coordinates or elements to click on is the same type of challenge I was testing above. But it&rsquo;s no wonder these computer use applications are still very inaccurate.</p>
<p>Letting transformer-based agents control robots will be a much harder problem of a similar type. Not only does it require attention to detail, but now the images are in 3D, they come at you many times per second, and actions need to be produced as quickly. But my prediction is that we will brute force this, and it will work &ldquo;well enough&rdquo; for enthusiasts and niche industrial use cases to benefit from humanoid robots. And that&rsquo;s the takeoff point for true vision, as we all intuitively understand it. Releasing humanoids at scale (and cars, to some extent) are when we really unleash the datastream that&rsquo;s needed to get models that can see as well as you or I can. This is probably one reason why many AI companies and labs are pushing them so hard - they also understand the data they collect will be more valuable than the money paid for the first units.</p>
<p>Once we have a few hundred thousand humanoids roaming around early adopters&rsquo; houses, we will start to see AI models that can use OpenSCAD and Google Maps. And, conveniently, that&rsquo;s also the missing capability that will make the humanoids really useful. We have interesting years ahead of us.</p>

</div>

<p>Lots of chatter right now about AI replacing software developers.</p>
<p>I agree - AI will take over software development. The question is: what work will be left when this happens?</p>
<p>Some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarks for the best LLMs still put them solidly in the &ldquo;bad at programming&rdquo; category, scoring in the 5th percentile of human programmers on common tests. Meanwhile, LLMs score in the 80th-95th percentile for law exams and 85th–100th for psychology, statistics, and many other less technical fields. More scores available in the &ldquo;simulated exams&rdquo; section of <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">https://openai.com/research/gpt-4</a>.</li>
<li>Engineers have been using language models like tabnine and copilot as &ldquo;super-stackoverflow&rdquo; style code assistance years before chatGPT released. This means much of the velocity increase we might expect from current LLMs&rsquo; ability to write code has already been &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; to the market.</li>
<li>Many of the trends making software development more costly are growing, not shrinking: Systems are becoming more distributed. The cloud lowered infrastructure costs but made applications more complex. We&rsquo;re making more and deeper integrations among disparate systems. Auth is becoming more secure and thus complex (managed identity, MFA, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Github copilot chat and other LLM dev tools are speeding up the rote stuff. I’ve seen it in my own work.</p>
<p>And I really do believe new AI models will do more than just the basics, maybe in the next couple of years. Even precluding &ldquo;AGI&rdquo;, the trend we are on is that more and more work is automatable, and engineers, especially more junior ones - are going to have to shift focus away from algorithmic work that AI can do.</p>
<p>But by the time our neural nets are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; at building software to make it significantly cheaper to build, I doubt this trend will make the news. Everything else gets automated too.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts at what seems to be the beginning of the next AI revolution in early 2024. I plan to revisit this topic and see if I&rsquo;m right in future posts.</p>]]></description>

    </div>

<p>It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Custom GPT&rdquo; - a customized version of chatGPT. Just give it some details about the API and then tell it in English what you want to get, post, update, whatever.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a PM, business analyst, or anyone that cares about APIs but doesn&rsquo;t like terminals and engineer-y tools like Postman, and you have ChatGPT plus, try it out. Here&rsquo;s a link:
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms</a></p>
<p>Important disclaimer: DON&rsquo;T use ChatGPT on corporate stuff if your company doesn&rsquo;t allow it! This was a fun experiment for me and I&rsquo;m definitely not using any corporate resources on it/for it. There are plenty of free APIs to try this out on. Maybe ask ChatGPT for some suggestions</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been occasionally challenging GPT to create models using <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, a &ldquo;programming language for 3D models&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both struggle, but GPT-4 has been a massive improvement. Here are both models&rsquo; outputs after asking for an acorn and 3 messages of me giving feedback:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

</div>

<p>For the record, it is impressive that these LLMs can get anything right with no visual input or training on shapes like these. Imagine looking at the programming reference for openSCAD and trying to do this blind. The fact that the 3.5 version has a bunch of strangely intersecting primitives and some union issues has been normal in my experience. It takes quite a bit of spatial logic to get a model not to look like that.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post retrospectively as I never published it at the time of creation. It will live here as a &ldquo;stake in the ground&rdquo; of AI software capabilities as of March 2023. Note- if you&rsquo;re reading on substack, this post won&rsquo;t work. Go to <a href="hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system/">hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system</a>.</p>
<p>The interactive solar system below was created with minimal help from me, by the very first version of GPT-4, before even function calling was a feature. It was the first of an ongoing series of experiments to see what frontier models could do by themselves - and I&rsquo;m posting it here because it was the earliest example I saved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the chat where it was created, though it&rsquo;s not possible to continue this conversation directly since the model involved has long since been deprecated: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387">https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387</a></p>

<div style="width:100%; max-width:1000px; margin:1em auto; position:relative; padding-top:70%;">
  <iframe
    src="/html/solar-system-self-contained.html"
    style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:1px solid #ccc;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">GPT-4 only wrote this for desktop, sorry phone users</span>
    
</div>

<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Click + Drag</kbd> to move the solar system around</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Up</kbd> to zoom in from the cursor location</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd> to zoom out</p>
<p>If you get lost, reload the page. That&rsquo;s an edge case GPT-4 didn&rsquo;t account for :)</p>
<p>Here was the initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be a long output, so if you need to break and I&rsquo;ll ask you to continue in another message feel free to do that. But please limit any non-code text prose to only essential statements to help mitigate this</p>
<p>I want you to make me a dynamic website. It should look good on mobile or on desktop, and I would like you to pick a nice dark background color and an interesting font to use across the page.</p>
<p>The page is intended to show the scale of the solar system in an interactive way, primarily designed for children to zoom in and out of different parts of the solar system and see planets and the Sun in relative scale. Mouse controls should also include panning around the model solar system, and should include text around planets with some statistics about their size, gravity, atmospheres, and any other fun facts you think would be educational and fun for 10-12 year olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I had to give it 4 more short prompts, one for a technical hint (to use html-5 since it was going a strange direction) and 3 for visual and mouse control misses.</p>
<p>It works - but missed some of the relatively simple directions, like the planet stats and rendering/controls for mobile. Still, I think it&rsquo;s cool to see the true scale of the planets on a zoomable canvas. And, it only goes to Neptune, the last true planet&hellip; don&rsquo;t go looking for Pluto.</p>
<p>For March 2023, this result was revolutionary - I was truly impressed. In 2025, it&rsquo;s not very impressive at all. How quickly we get used to progress!</p>]]></description>

<p>Of course, you lose a lot of the draw of NeRFs when you export the model into a 3d engine because it has to flatten all the textures and lighting, and also Luma AI cuts off 3D model exports as a jarring cube</p>
<p>But still - I was amazed at how well just applying a day/night lighting cycle and mesh colliders worked with this. Projectile and enemy physics played well too.</p>
<p>It’s still early days, but I could see 3D model generation from this tech getting a lot better and forming the basis for some really interesting user-generated content in the future!</p>
<p>Neat stuff - big thanks to Luma AI for the free toolset.</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Answering Machine is a proof-of-concept system that I built using <strong>pre-LLM</strong> natural language processing (NLP), specifically NLTK, to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>Looking back, this project was a great insight into what LLMs immediately allowed that was incredibly difficult before. This project was several months of work that the openAI sdk would probably have allowed in a few weeks - and that few weeks would have been mostly frontend design and a bit of prompting.</p>
<p><strong>Try it here:</strong> <a href="http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/</a>
<strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery">https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery</a></p>
<p>The system uses natural language processing to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>It is designed with simplicity in mind—upload any columnar dataset and start asking questions and getting answers. It uses advanced NLP algorithms to make assumptions about what data you&rsquo;re asking about and lets you correct those assumptions for follow-up questions if they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It is built entirely out of serverless components, which means there is no cost to maintain or run it other than the traffic the system receives.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How-to</h2>
<p>On a desktop or tablet, click the link in the header to navigate to the Answering Machine. For now, it isn&rsquo;t optimized for smartphone-sized screens.</p>
<p>In order to use the Answering Machine, you can either select one of the existing datasets, such as &ldquo;HR Activity Sample,&rdquo; or upload one of your own using the homepage of the site:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine homepage"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_uploads.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>To upload your own, click in the upload area or just drag a file straight from your desktop. For now, use CSV data files. Excel and other spreadsheet programs can easily save data in the CSV format using the &ldquo;File &gt; Save As&rdquo; or similar option in the menu. Each file needs a unique name.</p>
<p>When you hit the upload button, the site may not appear to change until the file is uploaded, at which point you&rsquo;ll see it appear in the box labeled &ldquo;Ask Your Data Anything&rdquo; below. Click on your file to start using it with the Answering Machine, or click the red trash can icon to delete it.</p>
<p>There are no user accounts in this system yet, so the data you upload might be seen by other users using the system. Try not to use sensitive data for now.</p>
<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h3>
<p>When you enter a dataset, you&rsquo;ll see a view that presents you with quite a bit of information:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    







    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine main view"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_hr.png"   style="height: auto; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The only part you need to focus on right now is the information panel. This panel lists out all the fields (columns), data types of those fields, and some sample data from a few records in your dataset:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine info panel"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_info.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>You can use this panel to start to formulate questions you might have about the data. If you see number values, you might ask about averages, maximums, or other math that might otherwise take some time to calculate. If you see a date, you can ask questions about the data in certain time periods.</p>
<p>Many datasets also contain fields that only have a few specific allowed values. When the Answering Machine sees fewer than 15 unique values in any field, the data type will be a &ldquo;List&rdquo; and it lists them right out under the sample values table. You can use this type of value to ask questions about records containing those specific values. For example, in the HR dataset, you might only be interested in data where the &ldquo;Education&rdquo; field&rsquo;s value is &ldquo;High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now look to the query bar to start asking your data questions:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine query bar"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_query.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The types of questions that will currently be automatically detected and answered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts of records where certain conditions are true</li>
<li>Math questions such as averages, medians, maximums, and minimums</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of questions can be made specific by using qualifying statements with prepositional phrases like &ldquo;in 2019&rdquo; or adjective phrases like &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;entry-level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Combining these two ideas, you can ask specific questions with any number of qualifiers, such as:<br>
<em>&ldquo;What was the median salary of male employees in the engineering department 5 years ago?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Upon hitting the &ldquo;Ask&rdquo; button (or hitting Enter), the Answering Machine will do its best to answer your question and will show you all of its work in this format:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine response"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_answer.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The last line in the response is the Answering Machine&rsquo;s answer. In this case, it is telling you the metric you asked for with all your stipulations is <strong>6871.6 dollars.</strong></p>
<p>Moving up, you see a series of assessments that the Answering Machine has made in order to filter and identify the data you are asking about. Statements like &ldquo;Best auto-detected Numeric Subject Found: salary with column: Compensation (Monthly)&rdquo; provide a glimpse into one of the Answering Machine&rsquo;s most advanced features, which uses a selection of NLP techniques to compare words and phrases that are similar in meaning, ultimately matching things you are asking about to fields and values that actually exist in your database.</p>
<p>At the very top of the response is how the Answering Machine&rsquo;s nested grammar parsing logic actually parsed your question, with some specific pieces color-coded:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> chunks indicate &ldquo;subjects&rdquo; that were detected. Subjects are what the Answering Machine thinks you&rsquo;re asking &ldquo;about.&rdquo; These should represent both the main subject and other supporting subjects in your question.</li>
<li><strong>Purple</strong> chunks are conditions. These are the things that the Answering Machine thinks you are trying to use to &ldquo;specify&rdquo; or filter data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that your question is answered, you might notice that some new green and purple colored bubbles have appeared in the sections of your screen labeled &ldquo;New Subjects&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Conditions.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo;:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine subjects and conditions"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_lexicon.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 400px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<h3 id="forming-concepts">Forming Concepts</h3>
<p>If the Answering Machine already understood what you were asking and successfully matched it to fields and values in your data, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything with these. But often you will be using domain-specific lexicon, or the auto-matching algorithm simply won&rsquo;t pick the correct value. These situations are what concepts are for.</p>
<p>To create a concept, click and drag on the green or purple &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo; bubble and move it out into the blank middle area of the screen. Then click and drag the field or field value from the info-panel at the top of the screen and drop it right on top of that bubble. You&rsquo;ll see both the data bubble and the lexicon bubble included in a larger gray bubble, which represents the concept:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine concept"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_concept.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 200px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>You can add more lexicon bubbles to this concept if they mean the same thing, but you can only use one data bubble.</p>
<p>Concepts override the Answering Machine&rsquo;s auto-matching logic. If you ask another question containing a subject or condition that is now matched by a user to a data value, that data value will be used instead of the auto-match. If the concept isn&rsquo;t working well, you can delete it by dragging all of the nested bubbles out of it either into the blank middle area or into the colored panel they originally came from.</p>
<p>Feel free to play around with new datasets and questions, and use the contact section of this site if you have comments or questions. When you ask questions or create/modify concepts, that data will automatically be saved to the server in real-time. You can close the page anytime and come back to your dataset to keep asking questions.</p>
<p>Remember that there are no user accounts, meaning you can share your dataset and work in tandem with others! But again, please do not upload sensitive data to this proof-of-concept tool as it will be available for other users to see and query.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The Answering Machine is a purely &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; application, meaning that there is no server hosting the various components of the application until those components are needed by a user. This is true for the database, the file storage, the static website, the backend compute, and the API orchestration.</p>
<p>For the cloud nerds out there, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">here is a great article</a> by Martin Fowler on what exactly &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; means, especially in terms of the backend compute portion, which is arguably the most valuable part of the application to be serverless. For reference, I am using Martin&rsquo;s 2nd definition of &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; here.</p>
<p>This is a high-level map of all of the components that make the Answering Machine work in its current (June 2020) state. The API gateways, CloudWatch events, and some triggers &ldquo;given for free&rdquo; by AWS are left out of this for readability:</p>
