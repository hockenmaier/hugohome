<p>Proofreader (<a href="https://lnkd.in/g45DGnDW)">https://lnkd.in/g45DGnDW)</a>:
This one is super simple. Give it what you’ve written and it will provide no-BS proofreads. It’s not going to hallucinate content, just point out mistakes and parts that don’t make sense.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

</div>

<p>Make Real (<a href="https://lnkd.in/gnwNTAd6)">https://lnkd.in/gnwNTAd6)</a>:
This makes your napkin drawings into working websites. It’s got some of the same limitations other code-generating AI tools do, but it does a surprisingly good job creating simple working web frontends for your ideas!</p>
<p>Postman for PMs (<a href="https://lnkd.in/gARtSQ6R">https://lnkd.in/gARtSQ6R</a>)
Talk to APIs using natural language instead of downloading technical tools or writing code (only unauthenticated APIs, for now). Also a great way to learn about APIs for newbies - Postman for PMs knows about some free online APIs to get started with.</p>
<p>The Boy (<a href="https://lnkd.in/gvwNuaXC">https://lnkd.in/gvwNuaXC</a>)
An experimental “AI generated RPG” where you play as “The Boy” who realizes fantastic superpowers. It’s fun to play around and explore, but don’t expect too much consistent gameplay from the currently available AI models.</p>
<p>Exciting times. Have fun!</p>

</div>

<p>Lots of chatter right now about AI replacing software developers.</p>
<p>I agree - AI will take over software development. The question is: what work will be left when this happens?</p>
<p>Some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarks for the best LLMs still put them solidly in the &ldquo;bad at programming&rdquo; category, scoring in the 5th percentile of human programmers on common tests. Meanwhile, LLMs score in the 80th-95th percentile for law exams and 85th–100th for psychology, statistics, and many other less technical fields. More scores available in the &ldquo;simulated exams&rdquo; section of <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">https://openai.com/research/gpt-4</a>.</li>
<li>Engineers have been using language models like tabnine and copilot as &ldquo;super-stackoverflow&rdquo; style code assistance years before chatGPT released. This means much of the velocity increase we might expect from current LLMs&rsquo; ability to write code has already been &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; to the market.</li>
<li>Many of the trends making software development more costly are growing, not shrinking: Systems are becoming more distributed. The cloud lowered infrastructure costs but made applications more complex. We&rsquo;re making more and deeper integrations among disparate systems. Auth is becoming more secure and thus complex (managed identity, MFA, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Github copilot chat and other LLM dev tools are speeding up the rote stuff. I’ve seen it in my own work.</p>
<p>And I really do believe new AI models will do more than just the basics, maybe in the next couple of years. Even precluding &ldquo;AGI&rdquo;, the trend we are on is that more and more work is automatable, and engineers, especially more junior ones - are going to have to shift focus away from algorithmic work that AI can do.</p>
<p>But by the time our neural nets are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; at building software to make it significantly cheaper to build, I doubt this trend will make the news. Everything else gets automated too.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts at what seems to be the beginning of the next AI revolution in early 2024. I plan to revisit this topic and see if I&rsquo;m right in future posts.</p>]]></description>

      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3O4r_q2Ioko?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Custom GPT&rdquo; - a customized version of chatGPT. Just give it some details about the API and then tell it in English what you want to get, post, update, whatever.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a PM, business analyst, or anyone that cares about APIs but doesn&rsquo;t like terminals and engineer-y tools like Postman, and you have ChatGPT plus, try it out. Here&rsquo;s a link:
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms</a></p>
<p>Important disclaimer: DON&rsquo;T use ChatGPT on corporate stuff if your company doesn&rsquo;t allow it! This was a fun experiment for me and I&rsquo;m definitely not using any corporate resources on it/for it. There are plenty of free APIs to try this out on. Maybe ask ChatGPT for some suggestions</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been occasionally challenging GPT to create models using <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, a &ldquo;programming language for 3D models&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both struggle, but GPT-4 has been a massive improvement. Here are both model&rsquo;s outputs after asking for an acorn and 3 messages of me giving feedback:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

</div>

<p>For the record, it is impressive that these LLMs can get anything right with no visual input or training on shapes like these. Imagine looking at the programming reference for openSCAD and trying to do this blind. The fact that the 3.5 version has a bunch of strangely intersecting primitives and some union issues has been normal in my experience. It takes quite a bit of spacial logic to get a model not to look like that.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_radiance_field">neural radiance fields</a> (NeRFs) lately and thought a fun way to explore them would be flying through them in the Treekeepers “Puddle Jumper” in true scale.</p>

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QguH3aK90Ck?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Of course, you lose a lot of the draw of NeRFs when you export the model into a 3d engine because it has to flatten all the textures and lighting, and also Luma AI cuts off 3D model exports as a jarring cube</p>
<p>But still - I was amazed at how well just applying a day/night lighting cycle and mesh colliders worked with this. Projectile and enemy physics played well too.</p>
<p>It’s still early days, but I could see 3D model generation from this tech getting a lot better and forming the basis for some really interesting user-generated content in the future!</p>
<p>Neat stuff - big thanks to Luma AI for the free toolset.</p>]]></description>

<p>I created this panel display in 2026 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>

<p>If you want to make this, all you need to do is set up a raspberry pi, download chromium (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to your action tiles panel.</p>
<p>If you want to mount the screen vertically like mine, then I have made an easier solution than going through the trouble of actually rotating the raspberry&rsquo;s display and touch device. Just use the html below and edit it to use your own panel&rsquo;s URL in the &ldquo;iframe&rdquo; element instead of mine. This will launch the panel rotated in your browser.</p>
