                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting my first full-time role in AI, in an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus and emphasize different things. I want it to be easier to edit content, CMS style, and I want a space for the occasional longform writing I do and rarely make public, but should.</p>
<p>I have these ideas for a few reasons, but one is that after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, he convinced me that I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence other than my corpo one on Linkedin, and I have a lot of private projects and ideas that should be somewhere. If nothing else, maybe my kids can read it someday. Talking to you, Alice :) Your cousin Lily keeps asking where you are and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupy the same space as Kaitlin.</p>

<h2 id="ball-machine---the-game">Ball Machine - The Game</h2>
<p>Most personal websites of professionals are very boring. I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; and &ldquo;a bit boring by nature&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Which is often working in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be consciously fun. I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid. That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, a ruler, a protractor, and myself, who was always thinking about physics simulation at the time. My favorite game in church growing up was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, and seeing where it would end up. This graph paper game was similar:</p>
<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the screen, where balls would start falling. I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going. Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet. The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;. I wish I still had some of these drawings. I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine. I hope you have fun with it, and that it&rsquo;s not too annoying if you&rsquo;re trying to read.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>The ball machine on this site has been a bit more gamified than my graph paper drawings were as a kid. Each time you load a page, you&rsquo;ll find a hoop somewhere on the page. Your goal is to get the ball to go through the hoop. Every time you do, another one will appear. Build off your existing track and see how many hoops you can get through - this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen. You get a point each time you get the ball through another hoop. Each post will be a slightly different game!</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I came across this tweet today that was surprisingly contentious. Maybe not so surprising given the state of Twitter, but still:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1762321041899012307">https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1762321041899012307</a></p>
<p>On the face of it, “people get twisted in their relationship with work” seems like a reasonable take. Stop complaining—you are making 16x the median salary in this country. Just do the boring job with the toxic team.</p>
<p>Let’s stop and think about this for a second. The original poster (OP from now on) is making $800K annually due to the appreciation of Spotify stock. An obscene amount of money? Maybe, maybe not. I do not have the typical hang-ups about the wealthy or ultra-wealthy. I don’t see this world as a zero-sum game, and I think the richest people out there have usually done some amazing things, especially in countries like the US where most wealth is not old wealth.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between founding a company you’re passionate about, which goes on to become incredibly valuable, and working for someone else doing a job you think is boring in order to join the 1%. In this article, I’m talking about the latter.</p>
<p>I propose this core question for this type of person: Is this large income worth doing a job you find boring, or working with people you feel are toxic? I would say no. Absolutely not. OP is clearly regretting how he’s spending his time at work. He should look for something to do that he values, even if it pays a quarter as much as he gets now. Or less!</p>
<h2 id="the-hedonic-treadmill">The Hedonic Treadmill</h2>
<p>There’s an often misquoted study from ~2010 that personal income beyond about $75K (presumed to cover basic necessities with a comfortable overhead) does not equate to further happiness. This number is actually about right when it comes to simple reported happiness, which has more to do with the hedonic treadmill than anything else. But the study in question was also measuring reported “life satisfaction” as surveyed, which did not stop increasing with income. Of course, “life satisfaction” is a fraught survey metric as well, as it might actually measure a perceived comparative number with one’s neighbors (we’ll get to this later).</p>
<p>But whatever the proper measure of happiness or satisfaction is, there is a great deal of logic to thinking its relationship with income looks like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="happiness income curve"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/treadmill-graph.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>As in: there are diminishing returns to incremental income. Not a revolutionary idea. It’s obvious. But it also means that somewhere along this curve is the often-quoted $75K, and somewhere far to the right is OP’s $800K. And the curve between those points is probably pretty flat.</p>
<p>What could OP get in return for moving to the left along this flat section of the curve? Eight hours of time per workday, at least, that he finds incrementally more valuable. How much do you think those 8 hours could improve his life satisfaction on their own happiness/hours curve?</p>
<p>This is where the real paradox comes in. Gaining wealth is supposed to make your time more valuable. You choose to get more services, have a housekeeper, maybe even a private chef. But if those things actually indicate a person values their time more highly than someone poorer, how come they would even consider sacrificing most of that time doing something they find boring, or with people they find annoying? Just to maintain their position along the flat section of the curve?</p>
<p>Maybe they aren’t prioritizing happiness at all.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-up-with-the-joneses">Keeping up with the Joneses</h2>
<p>My argument so far would be absolute blasphemy to most of the $500K+ salary people who don’t have much fun at work. Let’s talk about their two most common counterarguments:</p>







<div class="paige-quote">
<blockquote class="blockquote"><ol>
<li><em>&ldquo;Work should be a sacrifice, and more money means more security for my family.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


</div>

<p>This is noble. It’s also way too self-sacrificial for the extremely wealthy first-world people we’re talking about. You’re making $800K. There is not a salary sacrifice in the world that will make your family “insecure.”</p>
<p>And what pattern does this even establish? You’re going to choose to be unhappy for most of your waking hours so that you can guarantee your children will be able to do the same? What are you actually working for if not you or anyone else being able to actually enjoy themselves?</p>







<div class="paige-quote">
<blockquote class="blockquote"><ol start="2">
<li><em>&ldquo;But I could make this crazy money and then retire in 5 years.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


</div>

<p>Now this is a good argument! You could indeed retire in 5 years after making $800K per year and then spend your time with family or pursue passion projects! The problems here are twofold:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, nobody does this. Instead, they spend more money. Of course, some of it will be saved, but the main thing that happens when people find themselves with far more money than needed for their family’s security is that they spend it. Bigger houses, more trips, elite schools for the kids. These make you feel well-off compared to your neighbors but don’t push you much higher on that flat curve.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, people find value in being useful. There’s a reason why so many struggle in retirement. Even with a rigid FIRE plan, you’ll still want to work afterward on something interesting. So why not find that now?</p>
<p>What’s actually happening? Lifestyle creep. I think this is 90% of why people feel they could never work on something more fun or meaningful for less money. They’ve already started to spend their new money, and now losing those things would hurt more than gaining them felt good. That damn hedonic treadmill.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-go-from-here">Where we go from here</h2>
<p>What am I saying? I’m asking you to think deeply about what you value. Money isn’t a core value. Value your own time as much as your spending habits suggest you do. This is the right logic for your well-being, even if the world stays as it is. Now for my last thought:</p>
<p>I’m obsessed with AI and the technological singularity. It’s a healthy time to step back, reflect on the fundamental values driving our behavior, and make changes. Wouldn’t it be silly to spend most of our waking hours working miserably on meaningless things, only to arrive in a second half of life in a world of abundance?</p>
