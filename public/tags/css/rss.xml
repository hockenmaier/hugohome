                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting my first full-time role in AI, in an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus and emphasize different things. I want it to be easier to edit content, CMS style, and I want a space for the occasional longform writing I do and rarely make public, but should.</p>
<p>I have these ideas for a few reasons, but one is that after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, he convinced me that I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence other than my corpo one on Linkedin, and I have a lot of private projects and ideas that should be somewhere. If nothing else, maybe my kids can read it someday. Talking to you, Alice :) Your cousin Lily keeps asking where you are and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupy the same space as Kaitlin.</p>

<h2 id="ball-machine---the-game">Ball Machine - The Game</h2>
<p>Most personal websites of professionals are very boring. I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; and &ldquo;a bit boring by nature&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Which is often working in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be consciously fun. I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid. That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, a ruler, a protractor, and myself, who was always thinking about physics simulation at the time. My favorite game in church growing up was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, and seeing where it would end up. This graph paper game was similar:</p>
<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the screen, where balls would start falling. I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going. Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet. The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;. I wish I still had some of these drawings. I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine. I hope you have fun with it, and that it&rsquo;s not too annoying if you&rsquo;re trying to read.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>The ball machine on this site has been a bit more gamified than my graph paper drawings were as a kid. Each time you load a page, you&rsquo;ll find a hoop somewhere on the page. Your goal is to get the ball to go through the hoop. Every time you do, another one will appear. Build off your existing track and see how many hoops you can get through - this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen. You get a point each time you get the ball through another hoop. Each post will be a slightly different game!</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Control Panel</strong> is a hardware project I designed in 2016 to manage home automation systems. The project involved designing a custom 3D-printed case for a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a touchscreen interface.</p>

<p>I created this panel display in 2026 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>
