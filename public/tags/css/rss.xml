<p>Warning: This article has a lot of embedded code, so <a href="/this-website/#ball-machine---the-game">the ball machine</a> is slow unless you have a REALLY fast computer. Play at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, though.</p>
<p>GPT-5, as a simple text completion model, is not a revelation.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t so surprising. It was becoming clearer with every new raw LLM release that the fundamental improvements from scaling solely the performance of the core text predictor were starting to show diminishing returns. But I&rsquo;m going to make an argument today that, although the LLM itself is not nearly as much of a leap from GPT-4 as GPT-4 was from GPT-3, we have still seen at least a whole-version-number of real improvement between the release of GPT-4 and 5 as we did between 3 and 4. The reasons for that are mostly what exists around that LLM core.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to make this argument by showing you things the original GPT-4 could never have done.</p>
<h1 id="exhibit-a-a-new-solar-system">Exhibit A: A New Solar System</h1>
<p>GPT-5 came at a great time for me, because when OpenAI set the announcement to 8/7/25, I was in the middle of stress testing Agent Mode with the prior models. So, let me start by just illustrating the progress we had made between the first GPT-4 release in early 2023 and the capabilities of GPT-4 level models the week before the release of GPT-5.</p>
<p>Two years and four months have gone by since I ran my original Interactive Solar System experiment with the original version of GPT-4. You can play with it at <a href="/gpt-4-solar-system">hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system</a>.</p>
<p>Now have a look at the same test performed a week before the release of GPT-5, which uses ChatGPT Agent Mode:</p>
<p>

    padding-top: 70%;

</p>
<p>Here are Controls, again:</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Click + Drag</kbd> to move the solar system around</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Up</kbd> to zoom in from the cursor location</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd> to zoom out</p>
<p>And I again used this initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to make me a dynamic website. It should look good on mobile or on desktop, and I would like you to pick a nice dark background color and an interesting font to use across the page.</p>
<p>The page is intended to show the scale of the solar system in an interactive way, primarily designed for children to zoom in and out of different parts of the solar system and see planets and the Sun in relative scale. Mouse controls should also include panning around the model solar system, and should include text around planets with some statistics about their size, gravity, atmospheres, and any other fun facts you think would be educational and fun for 10-12 year olds.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite an improvement, right?</p>
<p>Like my original experiment, I didn’t one-shot this result. This is the final result after 7 prompts, but unlike in the original, those follow-up prompts were not primarily fixes - they were new features that I thought would be good additions after playing with each previous version - all of which worked right away.</p>
<p>The most striking part of this experiment for me is that, despite the plateau that has largely been observed in base LLMs, this result is clearly far above and beyond what GPT-4 was able to do when it first released, and the reasons for that have to do with what the labs have been building <em>around</em> the base models.</p>
<p>In the case of Agent mode, as far as we know, we have a GPT-4 class model at the root. o3, which is what Agent Mode uses, is a GPT-4 class model with chain-of-thought and lots of self-play training.</p>
<p>It also has the ability to use tools, like the web search tool it used to find the planet facts.</p>
<p>But then the thing that most sets it apart from its base model is the deep research and computer use elements of Agent mode. As it was building this model, I saw Agent mode do things such as perusing the internet with its text browser to find scale information and browse for textures it could use as planet skins.</p>
<p>It wrote and ran test code using its Code Interpreter tool.</p>
<p>It used its chain-of-thought &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; to respond to errors, rethink controls and scale decisions, and decide to go back and search the web or use other tools some more.</p>
<p>Then, the most impressive new ability that allowed it to make this: It ran this code on a local browser and <em>visually tested it</em>, clicking on the planets to make sure the information panels were coming up, zooming and panning around, and using its own toolbars.</p>
<p>This last one to me, when paired with all of the other things that GPT-4 class models are not instrumented to do, is the start of a true general capability for AI software testing, almost as a side note to all of the other things it will unlock in the coming few years. Not just the little unit and automated tests that LLMs have been writing into our codebases for a long time - but actual visual look and feel testing. This is a huge market and will be a huge shock to the software industry when it’s fully realized.</p>
<p>These are all net-new abilities that GPT-4 class models have gained since GPT-4 came out in March of 2023. It&rsquo;s hard to see how much progress these capabilities add up to without just running the direct experiment like this solar system generation.</p>
<h1 id="gpt-5-without-agent-mode">GPT-5 Without Agent Mode</h1>
<p>I see GPT-5 as a formalization of all of these capabilities that lock in the step change in capability we&rsquo;ve seen over the last 2 years. There is a new model underneath there somewhere (some are saying it is o4) and that underlying model has certainly been reinforcement-trained to choose its tools wisely. It is the first model I have seen that can do all of these simultaneously, without user choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose when to think and when to just answer</li>
<li>Run iterative web search calls</li>
<li>Write and run code to do highly logical-symbolic tasks like data analysis</li>
<li>Create, edit, and analyze images</li>
<li>Create and read nearly any kind of document a user might be working with</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are still a couple of things locked behind user choice, which is probably because these both result in much longer running and expensive tasks than simple thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep map-reduce style web research</li>
<li>Computer use (mouse and keyboard style, with Agent Mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using only the first set of &ldquo;default&rdquo; behaviors, GPT-5 can do things that the original GPT-4 could never have dreamed of. I have had the following prompt sitting around in my &ldquo;intelligence tests&rdquo; document for more than a year now under <em>&ldquo;Cool picross app idea, def solvable by competent AI (which doesn&rsquo;t exist yet at the end of 2024)&rdquo;</em>, waiting for a single model that can one-shot it. GPT-5 is the first one that does:</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-b-picross">Exhibit B: Picross</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Take an image, increase contrast, and turn it into a 15x15 image. Create a black and white picross puzzle out of the image, including a UI that lets a player solve the puzzle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple prompt that implies a lot of underlying complexity. Here is the first one-shot result from GPT-5 I got (normal mode, I didn&rsquo;t select &ldquo;Thinking&rdquo; in advance):</p>
<p><style>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t make all the choices I would have, but it worked in one shot, the first time I tried it. All the way from uploading an image and transforming that to a puzzle, to a whole UI that lets you solve it. I purposely left this here after its one-shot result just to demonstrate the progress. You could take this idea much further.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-c-the-baby-mesmerizer">Exhibit C: The Baby Mesmerizer:</h2>
<p>Now for the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve made with GPT-5 so far. I call this one the baby mesmerizer because baby Alice is absolutely stunned every time she sees it. I got this idea from another entertaining little physics simulation I saw somewhere.</p>
<p>I had GPT-5 make this one, then I tested it using the built-in runner in ChatGPT, changed it, and iterated on it 16 times. But I didn&rsquo;t write any of it myself - nor did I even open the code other than to tweak some variables to make it &ldquo;feel right&rdquo; here and there.</p>

</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>After you’re done messing around with this, take a detailed look at what has been built here. It is a tech demo, yes, but it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A nice-looking UI and color scheme</li>
<li>A side menu that dynamically operates as a fly-out menu based on screen size</li>
<li>A bunch of tunable variables, including niceties like minimums and maximums affecting each other</li>
<li>Dynamic generated sound effects</li>
</ul>
<p>I also thought it was interesting that GPT-5, when I said that it needed to run as a single HTML file with no external dependencies, chose to write its own physics for this. There is no prebuilt physics engine at all here.</p>
<p>This result is about 1400 lines of code. This isn’t a huge project, but it is far more than we could get a GPT to reliably produce just a year ago. The typical loop before was that you’d get past 200 lines of code or so, and then every new feature or bugfix requested would break two other things around the codebase, effectively enforcing a tiny complexity cap.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real: It&rsquo;s absolutely amazing that I could make something as complicated as this, exactly how I imagined it, just by describing it in English and a collective hour or two of testing. And though I like to code and have been bummed for a while that most straightforward coding like this is going the way of the dodo, this experience of not coding and instead just setting requirements and playing with the result was also a lot of fun. More fun than tearing through <a href="/on-ai-software-development-2/#agentic-ides">codespam in a tool like Cursor</a>. And frankly, I would never spend time making something like this if I had to code it all from scratch.</p>
<h1 id="a-plateau">A Plateau?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already read more than enough takes that GPT-5 signals the end of the current wave of AI, as a sort of intelligence plateau somewhere just below humans.</p>
<p>We should observe that we did not foresee the advancements that would get us from GPT-4 to GPT-5. Yet here we are: GPT-4 was <a href="/gpt-4-solar-system/">barely able to write 200 lines of buggy solar system code</a>, and GPT-5 one-shots it. The core model under the hood is likely a bit better, but it was proper tooling and reinforcement training on that tooling that really made the difference. And from what I hear, there are many other avenues of work that researchers say are still in early stages, such as reinforcement training on long-running agentic tasks and building the synthetic datasets that will allow for that.</p>
<p>So, even though GPT-5 doesn&rsquo;t seem like a huge advancement from models like o3 and Sonnet 4, hindsight makes the upward trajectory clear.</p>
<p>No matter how fast we see progress, there is clearly a ton of fun to have along the way!</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="/about-me">Brian Hockenmaier</a>, and this site is full of things I build and write about. I love making games and things with VR and AI. And I love DIY projects, especially ones involving programming, engineering and 3D modeling. Some of this has been cross or back-posted from my <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/hockenmaier/designs">thingiverse</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier">github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hockenmaier/">linkedin</a>, and other places, but it all lives here permanently.</p>
<p>This is an evolution of <a href="old-site/index.html">my previous site last updated in 2022, which I still keep inside this one</a> for posterity and for the AIs of the future to know more about me. I like it not because of the content as much as because it was a fully custom js and html site with no framework&hellip; and I think it&rsquo;s sort of fun and funny that it was like this.</p>
<p>All work and opinions here are my own, not my employer&rsquo;s.</p>
<h1 id="why-im-making-it">Why I&rsquo;m making it</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting a family as well as my first full-time role in AI. It&rsquo;s an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus, move several disparate collections into one place, and emphasize what I truly care about. I wanted it to be easier to add content, CMS style, and I wanted a space to occasionally post written content, too.</p>

</div>

<p>A big reason I&rsquo;m doing this now is that, after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, I was convinced I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence, nor do I want one, and over the years I have had a lot of projects and writing that I have unnecessarily kept private. AGI or not, there are non-artificial intelligences that may be interested one day. Talking to you, Alice :) When I started this website, your cousin Lily kept asking where you were and didn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupied the same space as Kaitlin.</p>
<p>I love some of the 2010s era blogs, and though mine is not going to be nearly as longform, nearly as focused on prose, or nearly as articulate, two of the sites I&rsquo;m trying to take inspiration from are <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/about/">Slate Star Codex</a> and <a href="https://gwern.net/about">Gwern&rsquo;s website</a> which are definitely advising on style here. Other than the fact that mine is also a game.</p>

<h1 id="etymology-of-hockenworks">Etymology of &ldquo;hockenworks&rdquo;</h1>
<p><strong>Hockenmaier</strong> is a great name. I&rsquo;ve always loved it. Not just because it’s unique and has my favorite number of letters, but because of its meaning, at least my family’s “folk-etymology” for it.</p>
<p>You have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hocken</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which can roughly translate to “sitting down, squatting, settling, idling”.</p>
<p>And then you have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Maier</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which has many different spellings, and ours has southern German roots, but all &ldquo;Meyer&rdquo; names come from the latin root &ldquo;maior&rdquo; meaning steward, administrator, or more generally &ldquo;worker&rdquo;</p>
<p>My family often puts these two ideas together as &ldquo;Lazy Worker,&rdquo; which is very on-brand for our sense of humor, but I think it&rsquo;s not just funny, but true.</p>
<p>“Lazy Worker” is perfect for someone who wants to get a lot done, especially in software engineering. We only have so many hours, and the best lives are lived restricting the number of hours spent on work that isn&rsquo;t done with people you love. So you better be efficient about it. You better be lazy. There are <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">many</a> <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">correct</a> <a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/">takes</a> out there on the value of being lazy when programming.</p>
<p>Now that we are starting to have AI, it&rsquo;s even better. A lazy worker like myself will not only avoid unnecessary work, but will delegate all that can be delegated to the new AI workers that are multiplying in our computers. That makes the &ldquo;steward&rdquo; connotation of &ldquo;Maier&rdquo; all the more fitting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to be the lazy worker, and this site is all about sharing my lazy works. My <em>hockenworks</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Most blogs and personal websites are a bit boring. I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; a bit boring by its nature, and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Which is often working, in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be intentionally fun. I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid. That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, plus a pencil, a ruler, and a protractor. I was a bit obsessed with physics simulation at the time. My favorite game in church growing up, where I was often daydreaming and looking at the huge arched ceiling, was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, to see where it would end up.

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Some of my early playtests got pretty chaotic</span>
    
</div>

<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the page, where balls would start falling. I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going, and how fast. Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet. The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;. I wish I still had some of these drawings. I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine. I hope you have fun with it and see all there is to unlock!</p>

<h2 id="how-its-made">How it&rsquo;s made</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t typically make complicated things like this with JavaScript. So when I found the perfect physics engine for the game - <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a> - I knew I would need help from our new little assistants. And though this game is a bit too structured to call it &ldquo;vibe coded&rdquo; - at times, it was close.</p>
<p>I ended up making my own tool called <a href="/context-caddy">Context Caddy</a> to help me with it. Part of the reason I leaned so hard into this is because I&rsquo;m always trying to push the limits of current AI, and I hadn&rsquo;t built a game since the GPT-4 days (I&rsquo;ll post about that soon). The new thinking models are truly a step above GPT-4 (this was mostly done with o3 and its minis) but they&rsquo;re still way too eager to write duplicate code, and they still don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; the structure of your project a lot of the time, especially with visual and physical things like this. Still, they were a great help here.</p>
<p>This game is made extra complicated by the fact that it runs on top of <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which is the static site generator behind the &ldquo;content&rdquo; part of this site. This probably doubled or tripled the effort of making this game. But, the balls in the &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo; of my youth would interact with my text notes and drawings, so this ball machine needed to do so as well.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit going on under the hood to make these two very distinct types of development projects work in tandem, and for both of them to work well. The Ball Machine would love to eat up all of the resources and make the site content unresponsive, and the content was quite a lot to dynamically build physical bodies and colliders around. I like the end result. But I like it a lot better on desktop, where the two can really interact, so I think you should play it on a real computer with a mouse.</p>

    This tube creates balls every time you click it
  </span>
  
</span>

<p>The ball machine on this site is a gamified version of my graph paper drawings as a kid. Each time you load a page, you&rsquo;ll see a little pneumatic delivery tube on the top right of the screen.</p>
<p>When you spawn your first ball, you&rsquo;ll see a few things appear. First - you&rsquo;ll find a goal     <span

</span>
 somewhere randomly on the page. Find a way to get the balls you spawn into that goal. But there is a bit of a trick - balls start out being worth 1 coin and accumulate another coin in value every two seconds. So, the longer you can keep balls around, the more they will be worth when going into the goals, and this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen and balls start bouncing off of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Clicking!</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game">a clicker game</a> - start by manually clicking the pneumatic delivery tube to spawn balls, but as you accumulate coins you&rsquo;ll be able to unlock different drawables and things that will let you accumulate more coins faster. If it feels like it&rsquo;s taking a while to make coins and unlock things, try playing around more with how the balls interact with the content, and use all of the tools you can draw. The site also works across multiple pages. And if all else fails&hellip; just give it time. This is a clicker game after all, so waiting is always a strategy! There is plenty to read while you wait.</p>
<p>It works best when you&rsquo;re on desktop, working on one tab at a time.</p>

<p>To start drawing your ball machine, you need to <kbd>Left Click</kbd> or <kbd>Tap</kbd> one of these drawable toggles in the main UI (top left of the screen)</p>
<p>When you have a drawable tool toggled on, you won&rsquo;t be able to click other links on the site. You&rsquo;ll see this visually indicated when you choose them. Unselect the currently selected tool in order to see it</p>
<p>Every drawable item (lines, launchers, and more) uses the following mechanics:</p>
<p> </p>
<h4 id="drawing-on-desktop">Drawing on Desktop</h4>
<p><strong>Spawn Balls:</strong> <kbd>Left Click</kbd> on the pneumatic spawner tube</p>
<p><strong>Draw Objects:</strong> <kbd>Left Click</kbd> and drag to see a preview, then <kbd>Left Click </kbd> to place</p>
<ul>
<li>Some drawables have a second action, like curved lines, that is previewed after the second click and confirmed with a third click</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancel Drawing</strong> After you&rsquo;ve started a line or other drawing but before you&rsquo;ve clicked again to confirm, <kbd>Right Click</kbd> to cancel it.</p>
<p><strong>Delete Objects:</strong> Hover over a drawn item and <kbd>Right Click</kbd> to delete it, getting 50% of your money back</p>

   Mobile Scroll Lock Warning:
</span>
 On Mobile, scrolling the page is blocked while you&rsquo;re drawing to allow you to draw lines in any direction.</p>
<p>You will need to untoggle your selected tool before you can scroll or click links.</p>
<p>If your phone has gesture controls to reload, go back or forward, or other browser things, you should disable them if you really want to play on your phone. Or, just play on desktop!</p>
<p><strong>Spawn Balls:</strong> <kbd>Tap</kbd> on the pneumatic spawner tube</p>
<p><strong>Draw Objects:</strong> <kbd>Touch and Drag</kbd> to see a preview, then <kbd>Release</kbd> to place</p>
<ul>
<li>Some drawables have a second action, like curved lines, that is previewed and confirmed on the next touch-and-drag.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancel Drawing</strong> After you&rsquo;ve started a line or other drawing but before you&rsquo;ve released to confirm, go back to where you started and release around there to cancel it. The threshold to cancel is within 25 pixels of where you started.</p>
<p><strong>Delete Objects:</strong> <kbd>Tap and hold</kbd> an object to delete it, getting 50% of your money back. You will see it pulse before it deletes.</p>

<strong>You get what you pay for&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>If you ever find yourself out of money, these dotted lines are free. They are not saved permanently like other lines and they go away after 50 balls hit them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>❌ A couple of things to watch out for when building ball machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balls have to be moving at all times. If they sit still for too long, they are considered dead and will poof out of existence.</li>
<li>This applies to balls hitting the goal, too. If your balls aren&rsquo;t moving much when they hit the target, they won&rsquo;t go in.
So keep your balls moving!</li>
</ul>
<p>😵 If you have a good run going, but it descends into chaos, it can be hard to recover. That&rsquo;s what the <kbd>Erase Balls</kbd> button above the draw tools is for!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each post on this site will be a slightly different randomized game! Try making ball machines on multiple pages at once. Your work will be saved in realtime, and you can make money even on pages you&rsquo;re not currently playing on.</p>

 These counters display how much <strong>sustainable</strong> coin revenue per second you&rsquo;re making on this page, and how much other pages you&rsquo;re not currently working on are contributing. Any balls that are spawned automatically and continuously travel through your contraption to hit the goal will be averaged into the top amount. When you visit other pages, you will keep making this money - that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;Other Pages&rdquo; revenue displays.</p>
<p>Your progress is saved to your device because your contraptions will be highly dependent on the screen size the site renders to.</p>
<p>The game works a bit differently on desktop and mobile, and the best experience is really on desktop - so try on a computer if you can! If on mobile, flip to landscape.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-game">The End of the Game</h3>
<p>Right now, the Ball Machine doesn&rsquo;t end, but you will be surprised the amount of money you can make across the whole site! Eventually, there will be other ways to spend coins on this site and potentially &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the ball machine. The late game items change the game in very interesting ways! I hope you make some fun machines on my website.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post retrospectively as I never published it at the time of creation. It will live here as a &ldquo;stake in the ground&rdquo; of AI software capabilities as of March 2023. Note- if you&rsquo;re reading on substack, this post won&rsquo;t work. Go to <a href="hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system/">hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system</a>.</p>
<p>The interactive solar system below was created with minimal help from me, by the very first version of GPT-4, before even function calling was a feature. It was the first of an ongoing series of experiments to see what frontier models could do by themselves - and I&rsquo;m posting it here because it was the earliest example I saved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the chat where it was created, though it&rsquo;s not possible to continue this conversation directly since the model involved has long since been deprecated: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387">https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387</a></p>

<div style="width:100%; max-width:1000px; margin:1em auto; position:relative; padding-top:70%;">
  <iframe
    class="lazy-iframe"
    data-src="/html/solar-system-self-contained.html"
    src="about:blank"
    loading="lazy"
    style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:1px solid #ccc;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">GPT-4 only wrote this for desktop, sorry phone users</span>
    
</div>

<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Click + Drag</kbd> to move the solar system around</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Up</kbd> to zoom in from the cursor location</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd> to zoom out</p>
<p>If you get lost, reload the page. That&rsquo;s an edge case GPT-4 didn&rsquo;t account for :)</p>
<p>Here was the initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be a long output, so if you need to break and I&rsquo;ll ask you to continue in another message feel free to do that. But please limit any non-code text prose to only essential statements to help mitigate this</p>
<p>I want you to make me a dynamic website. It should look good on mobile or on desktop, and I would like you to pick a nice dark background color and an interesting font to use across the page.</p>
<p>The page is intended to show the scale of the solar system in an interactive way, primarily designed for children to zoom in and out of different parts of the solar system and see planets and the Sun in relative scale. Mouse controls should also include panning around the model solar system, and should include text around planets with some statistics about their size, gravity, atmospheres, and any other fun facts you think would be educational and fun for 10-12 year olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I had to give it 4 more short prompts, one for a technical hint (to use html-5 since it was going a strange direction) and 3 for visual and mouse control misses.</p>
<p>It works - but missed some of the relatively simple directions, like the planet stats and rendering/controls for mobile. Still, I think it&rsquo;s cool to see the true scale of the planets on a zoomable canvas. And, it only goes to Neptune, the last true planet&hellip; don&rsquo;t go looking for Pluto.</p>
<p>For March 2023, this result was revolutionary - I was truly impressed. In 2025, it&rsquo;s not very impressive at all. How quickly we get used to progress!</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Answering Machine is a proof-of-concept system that I built using <strong>pre-LLM</strong> natural language processing (NLP), specifically NLTK, to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>Looking back, this project was a great insight into what LLMs immediately allowed that was incredibly difficult before. This project was several months of work that the openAI sdk would probably have allowed in a few weeks - and that few weeks would have been mostly frontend design and a bit of prompting.</p>
<p><strong>Try it here:</strong> <a href="http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/</a>
<strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery">https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery</a></p>
<p>The system uses natural language processing to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>It is designed with simplicity in mind—upload any columnar dataset and start asking questions and getting answers. It uses advanced NLP algorithms to make assumptions about what data you&rsquo;re asking about and lets you correct those assumptions for follow-up questions if they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It is built entirely out of serverless components, which means there is no cost to maintain or run it other than the traffic the system receives.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How-to</h2>
<p>On a desktop or tablet, click the link in the header to navigate to the Answering Machine. For now, it isn&rsquo;t optimized for smartphone-sized screens.</p>
<p>In order to use the Answering Machine, you can either select one of the existing datasets, such as &ldquo;HR Activity Sample,&rdquo; or upload one of your own using the homepage of the site:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine homepage"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_uploads.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>To upload your own, click in the upload area or just drag a file straight from your desktop. For now, use CSV data files. Excel and other spreadsheet programs can easily save data in the CSV format using the &ldquo;File &gt; Save As&rdquo; or similar option in the menu. Each file needs a unique name.</p>
<p>When you hit the upload button, the site may not appear to change until the file is uploaded, at which point you&rsquo;ll see it appear in the box labeled &ldquo;Ask Your Data Anything&rdquo; below. Click on your file to start using it with the Answering Machine, or click the red trash can icon to delete it.</p>
<p>There are no user accounts in this system yet, so the data you upload might be seen by other users using the system. Try not to use sensitive data for now.</p>
<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h3>
<p>When you enter a dataset, you&rsquo;ll see a view that presents you with quite a bit of information:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    







    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine main view"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_hr.png"   style="height: auto; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The only part you need to focus on right now is the information panel. This panel lists out all the fields (columns), data types of those fields, and some sample data from a few records in your dataset:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine info panel"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_info.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>You can use this panel to start to formulate questions you might have about the data. If you see number values, you might ask about averages, maximums, or other math that might otherwise take some time to calculate. If you see a date, you can ask questions about the data in certain time periods.</p>
<p>Many datasets also contain fields that only have a few specific allowed values. When the Answering Machine sees fewer than 15 unique values in any field, the data type will be a &ldquo;List&rdquo; and it lists them right out under the sample values table. You can use this type of value to ask questions about records containing those specific values. For example, in the HR dataset, you might only be interested in data where the &ldquo;Education&rdquo; field&rsquo;s value is &ldquo;High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now look to the query bar to start asking your data questions:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine query bar"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_query.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The types of questions that will currently be automatically detected and answered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts of records where certain conditions are true</li>
<li>Math questions such as averages, medians, maximums, and minimums</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of questions can be made specific by using qualifying statements with prepositional phrases like &ldquo;in 2019&rdquo; or adjective phrases like &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;entry-level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Combining these two ideas, you can ask specific questions with any number of qualifiers, such as:<br>
<em>&ldquo;What was the median salary of male employees in the engineering department 5 years ago?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Upon hitting the &ldquo;Ask&rdquo; button (or hitting Enter), the Answering Machine will do its best to answer your question and will show you all of its work in this format:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine response"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_answer.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The last line in the response is the Answering Machine&rsquo;s answer. In this case, it is telling you the metric you asked for with all your stipulations is <strong>6871.6 dollars.</strong></p>
<p>Moving up, you see a series of assessments that the Answering Machine has made in order to filter and identify the data you are asking about. Statements like &ldquo;Best auto-detected Numeric Subject Found: salary with column: Compensation (Monthly)&rdquo; provide a glimpse into one of the Answering Machine&rsquo;s most advanced features, which uses a selection of NLP techniques to compare words and phrases that are similar in meaning, ultimately matching things you are asking about to fields and values that actually exist in your database.</p>
<p>At the very top of the response is how the Answering Machine&rsquo;s nested grammar parsing logic actually parsed your question, with some specific pieces color-coded:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> chunks indicate &ldquo;subjects&rdquo; that were detected. Subjects are what the Answering Machine thinks you&rsquo;re asking &ldquo;about.&rdquo; These should represent both the main subject and other supporting subjects in your question.</li>
<li><strong>Purple</strong> chunks are conditions. These are the things that the Answering Machine thinks you are trying to use to &ldquo;specify&rdquo; or filter data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that your question is answered, you might notice that some new green and purple colored bubbles have appeared in the sections of your screen labeled &ldquo;New Subjects&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Conditions.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo;:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine subjects and conditions"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_lexicon.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 400px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<h3 id="forming-concepts">Forming Concepts</h3>
<p>If the Answering Machine already understood what you were asking and successfully matched it to fields and values in your data, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything with these. But often you will be using domain-specific lexicon, or the auto-matching algorithm simply won&rsquo;t pick the correct value. These situations are what concepts are for.</p>
<p>To create a concept, click and drag on the green or purple &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo; bubble and move it out into the blank middle area of the screen. Then click and drag the field or field value from the info-panel at the top of the screen and drop it right on top of that bubble. You&rsquo;ll see both the data bubble and the lexicon bubble included in a larger gray bubble, which represents the concept:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    





























    



    



    





    



    





    



    























<img  alt="Answering Machine concept"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/answering_machine_concept.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 200px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>You can add more lexicon bubbles to this concept if they mean the same thing, but you can only use one data bubble.</p>
<p>Concepts override the Answering Machine&rsquo;s auto-matching logic. If you ask another question containing a subject or condition that is now matched by a user to a data value, that data value will be used instead of the auto-match. If the concept isn&rsquo;t working well, you can delete it by dragging all of the nested bubbles out of it either into the blank middle area or into the colored panel they originally came from.</p>
<p>Feel free to play around with new datasets and questions, and use the contact section of this site if you have comments or questions. When you ask questions or create/modify concepts, that data will automatically be saved to the server in real-time. You can close the page anytime and come back to your dataset to keep asking questions.</p>
<p>Remember that there are no user accounts, meaning you can share your dataset and work in tandem with others! But again, please do not upload sensitive data to this proof-of-concept tool as it will be available for other users to see and query.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The Answering Machine is a purely &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; application, meaning that there is no server hosting the various components of the application until those components are needed by a user. This is true for the database, the file storage, the static website, the backend compute, and the API orchestration.</p>
<p>For the cloud nerds out there, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">here is a great article</a> by Martin Fowler on what exactly &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; means, especially in terms of the backend compute portion, which is arguably the most valuable part of the application to be serverless. For reference, I am using Martin&rsquo;s 2nd definition of &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; here.</p>
<p>This is a high-level map of all of the components that make the Answering Machine work in its current (June 2020) state. The API gateways, CloudWatch events, and some triggers &ldquo;given for free&rdquo; by AWS are left out of this for readability:</p>

<p>I created this panel display in 2016 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>

<p>If you want to make this, all you need to do is set up a raspberry pi, download chromium (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to your action tiles panel.</p>
<p>If you want to mount the screen vertically like mine, then I have made an easier solution than going through the trouble of actually rotating the raspberry&rsquo;s display and touch device. Just use the html below and edit it to use your own panel&rsquo;s URL in the &ldquo;iframe&rdquo; element instead of mine. This will launch the panel rotated in your browser.</p>
