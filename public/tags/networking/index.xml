      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/treekeepers_moonlight.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Treekeepers Puddle Jumper&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/&#34;&gt;Treekeepers VR Website&lt;/a&gt; for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
