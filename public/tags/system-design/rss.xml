                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Note from 2025: The Answering Machine is a proof-of-concept system that I built using pre-LLM natural language processing (NLP), specifically NLTK, to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>Looking back, this project was a great insight into what LLMs immediately allowed that was incredibly difficult before.  This project was several months of work that the openAI sdk would probably have allowed in a few weeks - and that few weeks would have been mostly frontend design and a bit of prompting.</p>
<p><strong>Try it here:</strong> <a href="http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/</a>
<strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery">https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_uploads.png" alt="Answering Machine homepage"></p>
<p>This proof-of-concept system uses natural language processing (NLP) to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain english.</p>
<p>It is designed with simplicity in mind - upload any columnar dataset and start asking questions and getting answers. It uses some advanced NLP algorithms to make assumptions about what data you&rsquo;re asking about, and will let you correct those assumptions for follow-up questions if they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It is built entirely out of serverless components, which means there is no cost to maintain or run it other than the traffic the system receives.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-to">How-to</h3>
<p>On a desktop or tablet, click the link in the header to navigate to the answering machine. For now it isn&rsquo;t optimized for smartphone-sized screens.</p>
<p>In order to use the answering machine, you can either select one of the existing data sets such as &ldquo;HR Activity Sample&rdquo; or upload one of your own using the homepage of the site:</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_uploads.png" alt="Answering Machine homepage"></p>
<p>To upload your own, click in the upload area or just drag a file straight from your desktop. For now, use csv data files. Excel and other spreadsheet programs can easily save data in the csv format using the &ldquo;File &gt; Save As&rdquo; or similar option in the menu. Each file needs a unique name.</p>
<p>When you hit the upload button, the site may not appear to change until the file is uploaded, at which point you&rsquo;ll see it appear in the box labeled &ldquo;Ask Your Data Anything&rdquo; below. Click on your file to start using it with the answering machine, or click the red trash can icon to delete it.</p>
<p>There are no user accounts in this system yet, so the data you upload might be seen by other users using the system. Try not to use sensitive data for now.</p>
<p>When you enter a dataset, you&rsquo;ll see a view that presents you with a quite a bit of information:</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_hr.png" alt="Main view of Answering Machine"></p>
<p>The only part you need to focus on right now is the information panel. This panel lists out all of the fields (columns), data types of those fields, and some sample data from a few records in your data set:</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_info.png" alt="Answering Machine info panel"></p>
<p>You can use this panel to start to formulate questions you might have about the data. If you see number values, you might ask about averages, maximums, or other math that might otherwise take some time to calculate. If you see a date, you can ask questions about the data in certain time periods.</p>
<p>Many datasets also contain fields that only have a few specific allowed values. When the answering machine sees less than 15 unique values in any field, the data type will be a &ldquo;List&rdquo; and it lists them right out under the sample values table. You can use this type of value to ask questions about records containing those specific values. For example in the HR data set, you might only be interested in data where the &ldquo;Education&rdquo; field&rsquo;s value is &ldquo;High School&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now look to the query bar to start asking your data questions:</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_query.png" alt="Answering Machine query bar"></p>
<p>The types of questions that will currently be automatically detected and answered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts of records where certain conditions are true</li>
<li>Math questions such as averages, medians, maximums, and minimums</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of questions can be made specific by using qualifying statements with prepositional phrases like &ldquo;in 2019&rdquo; or adjective phrases like &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;entry-level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Combining these two ideas, you can ask specific questions with any number of qualifiers, such as: &ldquo;What was the median salary of male employees in the engineering department 5 years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon hitting the &ldquo;ask&rdquo; button (or hitting Enter), the answering machine will do its best to answer your question, and will show you all of its work in this format:</p>
<p><img src="/images/answering_machine_answer.png" alt="Answering Machine response"></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>The Answering Machine is a purely &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; application, meaning that there is no server hosting the various components of the application until those components are needed by a user. This is true for the database, the file storage, the static website, the backend compute, and the API orchestration.</p>
<p>For the cloud nerds out there, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">here is a great article</a> by Martin Fowler on what exactly &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; means, especially in terms of the backend compute portion which is arguably the most valuable part of the application to be serverless. For reference, I am using Martin&rsquo;s 2nd definition of &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; here.</p>
<p>This is a high-level map of all of the components that make the answering machine work in its current (June 2020) state. The API gateways, cloudwatch events, and some triggers &ldquo;given for free&rdquo; by AWS are left out of this for readability:</p>

<p>Land War is an 8-player strategy game I developed as a solo project and released to Steam in March of 2019.<br>
This game was intended to have low art requirements and simple interaction rules that result in deep strategic gameplay.</p>
<p>The core concept is that of an ultra-simplified real-time-strategy game. Each player is represented by a color and can grow their territory by moving in any direction. The strategic elements occur when players encounter other players and have to make choices about which side of their land to defend or give up. Players can use the structure of the map and the coordinated action of other players to gain defensible footholds in order to take more area and eventually be the last player on the board.</p>

    </div>

<p>A full game of the final product released on Steam played on a Windows computer.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>I built Land War over the course of 7 months and 400 hours of work using Unity with C#. Though art requirements were intentionally low for a video game, I still had to produce several hundred static graphics and GIFs, and commissioned custom music for the menu and gameplay.</p>
<p>This project is one of my favorite examples of what can be done in relatively little time with a focused vision and a constant eye on scope creep. From the very start, I knew that a key to making compelling software was to flesh out the core concept before all else. This is why I started on the most fundamental strategic interaction of the players and built an MVP version of the game without a menu, sound, art, or even a win condition.</p>
<p>I started the project on a Memorial Day Monday, and by Friday had a rudimentary prototype playable with 8 players on Nintendo Joy-Con controllers paired to a Windows machine via Bluetooth.<br>
This is what the project looked like for my first play-test with other people 5 days in:</p>

<p><em>4-player game played with Nintendo Joy-Cons on a build of the game from 5 days into development.</em></p>
<p>From there, I continued to work on depth and full feature functionality including menus, a tutorial, a map generator, a dynamic scoring and round system, better sound and sprite graphics, different play modes and settings, and support for many controllers. I released the game with very little marketing aside from some Reddit posts and a physical handout at E3 but was happy to receive positive reviews and several hundred purchases of the game.</p>

<p>I created this panel display in 2026 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>
