<p>Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.</p>
<p>Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the <a href="https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/">Treekeepers VR Website</a> for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.</p>
<p>I initially designed the project for SteamVR only using the SteamVR SDK but quickly realized that a VR game released only on PC would miss the majority of the userbase, as the (then Oculus) Quest 2 was quickly dominating the market. Treekeepers was a good fit for a mobile platform with its simple low-poly cel-shaded design, so I pivoted to using OpenXR about two months into the project to support VR interactions on both PC and mobile (Android) devices like the Quest 2.</p>
<p>By summer 2022, I had a releasable product, albeit only with one “world” available. I decided to push the game to early access to gather rapid feedback from real players, and after getting approved for both storefronts, Treekeepers released to early access on September 30, 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Human Joystick VR</strong> explores a hybrid locomotion system where players move through a virtual environment by physically changing their position within their VR playspace.</p>
<p>Link to the project: <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/humanjoystick">Human Joystick on Github</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Human Joystick&rdquo; solves a common VR problem: providing natural movement in large virtual environments. Players can physically move within a playspace, but once they approach the edge, the system detects the movement vector and shifts the playspace accordingly.</p>
<p>This allows players to explore vast virtual spaces while maintaining immersion and reducing nausea.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>This project was my first VR experience, designed to address virtual movement challenges. Inspired by consumer VR’s limitations in 2016, I aimed to merge physical and artificial locomotion for a more natural experience.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deadzone and active zone</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players remain stationary when in the center (deadzone).</li>
<li>Movement starts when stepping into the active zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjustable speed and direction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed scales with distance from the center.</li>
<li>Supports smooth transitions between directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite achieving basic functionality, there were usability issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recentering difficulty</strong>: Players struggled to naturally return to the center without visual aids.</li>
<li><strong>Directional accuracy</strong>: Switching movement directions without recentralizing was less intuitive than expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>Watch the system in action:</p>

<em>Moving forward and left in the active zone at half max speed.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Though the project remains a prototype, the system demonstrates the potential of combining physical and artificial movement for immersive VR. The code is available for download and experimentation on GitHub.</p>
