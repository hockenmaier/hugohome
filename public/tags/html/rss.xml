                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting my first full-time role in AI, in an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus and emphasize different things. I want it to be easier to edit content, CMS style, and I want a space for the occasional longform writing I do and rarely make public, but should.</p>
<p>I have these ideas for a few reasons, but one is that after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, he convinced me that I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence other than my corpo one on Linkedin, and I have a lot of private projects and ideas that should be somewhere. If nothing else, maybe my kids can read it someday. Talking to you, Alice :) Your cousin Lily keeps asking where you are and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupy the same space as Kaitlin.</p>

<h2 id="ball-machine---the-game">Ball Machine - The Game</h2>
<p>Most personal websites of professionals are very boring. I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; and &ldquo;a bit boring by nature&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Which is often working in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be consciously fun. I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid. That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, a ruler, a protractor, and myself, who was always thinking about physics simulation at the time. My favorite game in church growing up was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, and seeing where it would end up. This graph paper game was similar:</p>
<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the page, where balls would start falling. I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going. Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet. The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;. I wish I still had some of these drawings. I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine. I hope you have fun with it, and that it&rsquo;s not too annoying if you&rsquo;re trying to read.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>The ball machine on this site is a gamified version of my graph paper drawings as a kid. Each time you load a page, you&rsquo;ll find a goal somewhere on the page. Your goal is to get the ball into that goal. But there is a bit of a trick - balls start out being worth 1 coin, and the longer you can keep balls around, the more they will be worth when going into the goals - this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen and balls start bouncing off of each other. And don&rsquo;t let balls sit around trying to get them to accumulate value too long - balls disappear when they&rsquo;ve been still too long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clicker game - start by manually clicking the pneumatic tube to spawn balls, but as you accumulate coins you&rsquo;ll be able to unlock different drawables and things that will let you accumulate more coins faster.</p>
<p>Each post on this site will be a slightly different randomized game! Try making ball machines on multiple pages at once&hellip;</p>
<p>The game works a bit differently on desktop and mobile, and the best experience is really on desktop - so try on a computer if you can!</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Control Panel</strong> is a hardware project I designed in 2016 to manage home automation systems. The project involved designing a custom 3D-printed case for a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a touchscreen interface.</p>

<p>I created this panel display in 2026 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>
