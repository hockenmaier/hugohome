        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The Characters</span>
    
</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few clones or slight alterations of games I like before (links to nope and hocken pocket blokus) but blue more bust is my first attempt at something of my own design and very high production quality.</p>
<p>(Pics)</p>
<p>This is a risk-taking game where players compete to take over a tree with their specific type of fruit. Trees and bees are becoming a recurring theme in my games!</p>
<p>All parts of this game or hand designed by me, mostly in VR with a tool called gravity Sketch, blender, and one of my favorite programmer&rsquo;s 3D tools called OpenSCAD.</p>
<p>(Link those)</p>
<p>Of all my models, this one takes most advantage of my multicolor BambuLab printer. All parts including the custom box which cleverly incorporates the instructions and game board itself are printed in bamboo lab Matte PLA, which in my opinion is probably the most beautiful way to print.</p>
<p>Production is batched with 80 to 150 of each fruit or bee on a build plate, but heavily limited by the game board and latching box each requiring a separate print.</p>
<p>I have looked into outsourcing production of this game so that I can actually distribute it but that has not happened yet since its design is so dependent on multicolor 3D printing, and most print farms would require nearly 30 bucks to produce it, let alone shipping it and my own margin. Injection molding is an option but also gets expensive with this level of detailed color, and requires remodeling in several significant ways. It still might happen. Or I might put it out on a site that lets people buy the model and print it themselves.</p>

<p>Play time is about 20 minutes for the 3-5 player version, and 25-30 minutes for the 6-8 player version. Learning how to play the game takes 1-5 minutes depending on the attention span of the players. Have fun!</p>
<p>See Thingiverse for all of the files:

<h1 id="print-instructions">Print Instructions</h1>
<p>3D-Print 88 tokens.</p>
<p>2D-Print the 2 included PDFs back-to-back, so that the numbers appear on the one side and the identical backsides are on the back. Or, leave out the backs as they are not necessary to play the game. Cut 9 cards out of each paper when they&rsquo;re done printing, along the gray lines.</p>
<p>It is recommended to either print on heavy duty paper, or to laminate the resulting cards.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make your own layout with larger or smaller cards using the included zip file of images.</p>
<p>For the 3-5 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 35. For the 6-8 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 46.</p>
<h1 id="to-play">To Play:</h1>
<p>Here is a link to the 3-5 player instructions:

<p>The 6-8 player instructions are almost exactly the same as the 3-5 player game:
-All players still receive 11 tokens at the beginning of the game.
-play with the 3-46 deck, shuffle the deck, and remove 11 cards instead of 9 cards before playing.</p>]]></description>
