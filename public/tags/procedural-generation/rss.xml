                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting my first full-time role in AI, in an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus and emphasize different things.  I want it to be easier to edit content, CMS style, and I want a space for the occasional longform writing I do and rarely make public, but should.</p>
<p>I have these ideas for a few reasons, but one is that after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, he convinced me that I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence other than my corpo one on Linkedin, and I have a lot of private projects and ideas that should be somewhere.  If nothing else, maybe my kids can read it someday.  Talking to you, Alice :)  Your cousin Lily keeps asking where you are and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupy the same space as Kaitlin.</p>

<h2 id="ball-machine---the-game">Ball Machine - The Game</h2>
<p>Most personal websites of professionals are very boring.  I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; and &ldquo;a bit boring by nature&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing.  Which is often working in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be consciously fun.  I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid.  That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, a ruler, a protractor, and myself, who was always thinking about physics simulation at the time.  My favorite game in church growing up was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, and seeing where it would end up.  This graph paper game was similar:</p>
<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the screen, where balls would start falling.  I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going.  Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet.  The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;.  I wish I still had some of these drawings.  I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine.  I hope you have fun with it, and that it&rsquo;s not too annoying if you&rsquo;re trying to read.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>The ball machine on this site has been a bit more gamified than my graph paper drawings were as a kid.  Each time you load a page, you&rsquo;ll find a hoop somewhere on the page.  Your goal is to get the ball to go through the hoop.  Every time you do, another one will appear.  Build off your existing track and see how many hoops you can get through - this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen.  You get a point each time you get the ball through another hoop.  Each post will be a slightly different game!</p>

<p>The Flapper is a project that spawned out of a simple movement mechanic test that turned out to be surprisingly fun!  The idea is to flap your arms to fly - and have it be a multiplayer battle to really get people moving.</p>
<p>Most of the start of this game was just tuning the movement mechanic, which borrowed from some physics realities and some elements I made up to make flapping feel good.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of one of the later states of the game, where I have it fully networked and am testing with friends, though it still has a few bugs here:</p>

</div>

<p>Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.</p>
<p>Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the <a href="https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/">Treekeepers VR Website</a> for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.</p>
<p>I initially designed the project for SteamVR only using the SteamVR SDK but quickly realized that a VR game released only on PC would miss the majority of the userbase, as the (then Oculus) Quest 2 was quickly dominating the market. Treekeepers was a good fit for a mobile platform with its simple low-poly cel-shaded design, so I pivoted to using OpenXR about two months into the project to support VR interactions on both PC and mobile (Android) devices like the Quest 2.</p>
<p>By summer 2022, I had a releasable product, albeit only with one “world” available. I decided to push the game to early access to gather rapid feedback from real players, and after getting approved for both storefronts, Treekeepers released to early access on September 30, 2022.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Land War is an 8-player strategy game I developed as a solo project and released to Steam in March of 2019.<br>
This game was intended to have low art requirements and simple interaction rules that result in deep strategic gameplay.</p>
<p>The core concept is that of an ultra-simplified real-time-strategy game. Each player is represented by a color and can grow their territory by moving in any direction. The strategic elements occur when players encounter other players and have to make choices about which side of their land to defend or give up. Players can use the structure of the map and the coordinated action of other players to gain defensible footholds in order to take more area and eventually be the last player on the board.</p>

<p>A full game of the final product released on Steam played on a Windows computer.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>I built Land War over the course of 7 months and 400 hours of work using Unity with C#. Though art requirements were intentionally low for a video game, I still had to produce several hundred static graphics and GIFs, and commissioned custom music for the menu and gameplay.</p>
<p>This project is one of my favorite examples of what can be done in relatively little time with a focused vision and a constant eye on scope creep. From the very start, I knew that a key to making compelling software was to flesh out the core concept before all else. This is why I started on the most fundamental strategic interaction of the players and built an MVP version of the game without a menu, sound, art, or even a win condition.</p>
<p>I started the project on a Memorial Day Monday, and by Friday had a rudimentary prototype playable with 8 players on Nintendo Joy-Con controllers paired to a Windows machine via Bluetooth.<br>
This is what the project looked like for my first play-test with other people 5 days in:</p>

<p>From there, I continued to work on depth and full feature functionality including menus, a tutorial, a map generator, a dynamic scoring and round system, better sound and sprite graphics, different play modes and settings, and support for many controllers. I released the game with very little marketing aside from some Reddit posts and a physical handout at E3 but was happy to receive positive reviews and several hundred purchases of the game.</p>
