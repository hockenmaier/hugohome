                    <description><![CDATA[<p>During my parental leave, I played through quite a few video games - something I love and one of the easiest ways to spend time while rocking my daughter to sleep. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</li>
<li>Carto</li>
<li>Tunic</li>
<li>Abzu</li>
<li>SteamWorld: Build</li>
<li>World of Goo 2</li>
<li>Oblivion Remastered</li>
<li>Mario Kart World</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/?srsltid=AfmBOoo2NFhtC_5yRr0Ne1WZoyYZOkMOwZjehQvzRZY4WvEFXcwCnXC8">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these are indie titles, but the one I spent the most time on was the Oblivion Remaster - one which surprised me both with how good it looks and with how well it played. Oblivion is a 19 year old game, and a purely graphics-related overhaul should not have made it as good or better than modern AAA games releasing today, but in my opinion (and many others I’m reading) it absolutely did. How could this be?</p>
<h1 id="graphics">Graphics</h1>
<p>Well - I think that’s pretty clear. The only thing that has really improved about mainstream gaming in the last 20 years is graphics.</p>
<p>And boy have the graphics improved. Oblivion not only uses new techniques like ray-tracing and revamped 4K textures and normal maps etc, it uses the full suite of global illumination provided by <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-global-illumination-and-reflections-in-unreal-engine">Unreal Engine</a>, which mean when you turn the settings up, it depends on hardly any of the typical tricks games need to use, like baked light maps, instead lighting almost everything in the game dynamically or “procedurally”, including things like reflections of reflections and lit up dust and fog.</p>
<p>{Insert GIF from my playthrough, potentially outdoor torches in bruma in morning or afternoon with mountains in the background}</p>
<p>Yes, Oblivion still has some simplistic design in terms of how landscapes are laid out, but that simplicity might also be why people can run it with Nvidia Lumen set up to run at ultra. Lighting is what’s really differentiating in video game graphics now, and fully simulated lighting beats or meets nearly every AAA game releasing lately that all cost 10s or 100s of millions to make.</p>
<h1 id="not-graphics">Not Graphics</h1>
<p>Left unstated is why nothing else has improved. Walking around Oblivion, meeting characters that have some scripted voice lines, responding to them with 1 of 4 options, holding down the left stick to sprint, and hitting a single button on your controller to watch your character animate a full scripted sword swing are all things that happen in the best and greatest RPGs of today. The same can be said of other genres - mechanics are largely untouched for the last 20 years outside of some common quality of life changes in how menus and inventory and HUDs work.</p>
<p>Here’s my theory for why: The games industry got to the threshold of what was comfortable and possible with current input and output mechanisms for humans to interact with games in only a few years after they was technically possible. Looking at a flat screen in front of you and pressing buttons on a controller or keyboard/mouse are incredibly limiting for no other media than games. Reading, watching films, and all kinds of media in between essentially max out on one screen and limited input, but games immediately ran into them as a barrier.</p>
<p>I wrote a little about this topic in <a href="/social-media-is-antisocial">my first post about VR and why I think it’s the future</a>. The only true innovation in gameplay that is happening in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indie, where one-man teams can come up with strange mashups and mechanics can execute on a vision spending very little. These are almost never totally genre definiing, but they are inventive.</li>
<li>VR, where we have only scratched the surface of mechanics that work and what is possible when the player’s entire hands and 3D field of view are in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>AAA game developers are excluded from the first by definition and is excluded from the second by their own financial decision makers.</p>
<h1 id="so-what">So What?</h1>
<p>Maybe people want to keep buying the same games with better graphics forever. I don&rsquo;t think they do. I think those decision makers that aren&rsquo;t investing in truly new AAA gameplay are short sighted. As long as we’ve been hearing that VR is the future and not seeing it totally come to fruition, at some point these companies that are milking the same game franchises for years will face the reality that people will only buy the same games reskinned with better graphics for so long. They&rsquo;ll either be replaced by companies that innovate or individuals using AI that will be plenty good at recreating the same game over and over again.</p>
<p>I am hoping that the current hypestorm around AI re-kindles the ideas in the hearts of AAA game studio CFOs that they might need to invest in innovation and new ideas again. Some of the things that make Oblivion just like any RPG of today (Think about the 4 option scripted discourse and stuffy voice lines as two) would be meaningfully different if AI was applied in the right way. And I think they’d be far more powerful experiences, just like I think VR games can be - so much higher fidelity and responsive to player input.</p>
<p>We will see. The combo of a decline in AAA game spending and AI hype feel like ripe conditions for innovation to return to gaming, to me.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting my first full-time role in AI, in an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus and emphasize different things. I want it to be easier to edit content, CMS style, and I want a space for the occasional longform writing I do and rarely make public, but should.</p>
<p>I have these ideas for a few reasons, but one is that after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, he convinced me that I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence other than my corpo one on Linkedin, and I have a lot of private projects and ideas that should be somewhere. If nothing else, maybe my kids can read it someday. Talking to you, Alice :) Your cousin Lily keeps asking where you are and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupy the same space as Kaitlin.</p>
<p>I love some of the 2010&rsquo;s era blogs and though mine is not going to be nearly as longform, nearly as focused on prose, or nearly as articulate, two of the sites I&rsquo;m trying to take inspiration from are <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/about/">Slate Star Codex</a> and <a href="https://gwern.net/about">Gwern&rsquo;s website</a> which are definitely advising on style here.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ball-machine---the-game">Ball Machine - The Game</h2>
<p>Most blogs and personal websites are a bit boring. I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; and &ldquo;a bit boring by nature&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Which is often working, in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be intentionally fun. I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid. That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, a ruler, a protractor, and myself, who was always thinking about physics simulation at the time. My favorite game in church growing up was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, and seeing where it would end up. This graph paper game was similar:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="balls everywhere"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="http://localhost:1313/images/this-website-ball-machine-1.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Some of my early playtests got pretty chaotic</span>
    
</div>

<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the page, where balls would start falling. I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going. Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet. The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;. I wish I still had some of these drawings. I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine. I hope you have fun with it and see all there is to unlock!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick Disclaimer: The best experience is on desktop or tablet - something with more screen real-estate than a phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ball machine on this site is a gamified version of my graph paper drawings as a kid. Each time you load a page, You&rsquo;ll see a little pneumatic delivery tube on the top right of the screen. This tube is where the balls show up when you click.</p>
<p>When you spawn your first ball, you&rsquo;ll see a few things appear. First - you&rsquo;ll find a goal (look for a &ldquo;target&rdquo;) somewhere randomly on the page. Find a way to get the balls you spawn into that goal. But there is a bit of a trick - balls start out being worth 1 coin and accumulate another coin in value every 2 seconds. So, the longer you can keep balls around, the more they will be worth when going into the goals, an this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen and balls start bouncing off of each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clicker game - start by manually clicking the pneumatic tube to spawn balls, but as you accumulate coins you&rsquo;ll be able to unlock different drawables and things that will let you accumulate more coins faster.</p>
<h3 id="drawables">Drawables</h3>
<p>To start drawing your ball machine, you need to click or tap one of the drawables in the main UI:</p>
<p>{image}</p>
<p>Every drawable item (lines, launchers, and more) uses the following mechanics:</p>
<p>On Desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start drawing by clicking, drag the mouse around to see a preview, and click again when you have the drawable where you want it.</li>
<li>Some drawables have a second action, like curved lines, that is previewed after the second click and confirmed with a third</li>
<li>Hover over a drawn item and right click to delete it.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Mobile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap and drag to see a preview, and release when you have the drawable in the right spot.</li>
<li>Second actions for the drawable will start on the next tap-and-drag.</li>
<li>Tap and hold on a drawable to delete it - you will see it pulse before it deletes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t draw an item, you probably can&rsquo;t afford it. You&rsquo;ll see the gold prices of the items flash red in the UI when this happens.</p>
<p>When you have a Drawable tool toggled on, you won&rsquo;t be able to click other links on the site. You&rsquo;ll see this visually indicated when you choose them. Unselect the currently selected tool in order to see it</p>
<h1 id="tips-on-making-money">Tips on Making Money</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ll quickly find ways to lengthen your Rube-Golberg Machines and build up value before you send balls into the goal. A couple of things to watch out for though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balls have to be moving at all times. If they sit still for too long, they are considered dead and will poof out of existence.</li>
<li>This applies to balls hitting the goal too. If your balls aren&rsquo;t moving when they hit the target, they won&rsquo;t go in.
So keep your balls moving!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each post on this site will be a slightly different randomized game! Try making ball machines on multiple pages at once. Your work will be saved in realtime, and you can make money even on pages you&rsquo;re not currently playing on. Try it!</p>
<p>Your progress is saved to your device because your contraptions will be highly dependent on the screen size the site renders to.</p>
<p>The game works a bit differently on desktop and mobile, and the best experience is really on desktop - so try on a computer if you can!</p>
<h2 id="how-its-made">How it&rsquo;s made</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t typically make complicated things like this with javascript. So when I found the perfect physics engine for the game - <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a> - I knew I would need help from our new little assistants. And though this game is a bit too structured to call it &ldquo;vibe coded&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s close. I ended up making my own tool called <a href="/context-caddy">Context Caddy</a> to help me with it. Part of the reason I leaned so hard into this is because I&rsquo;m always trying to push the limits of current AI, and I hadn&rsquo;t built a game since the GPT-4 days. The new thinking models are truly a setup above GPT-4 (this was mostly done with o3 and its minis) but they&rsquo;re still way to eager to write duplicate code, and they still don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; the structure of your project a lot of the time, especially with visual and physcial things like this. Still, they were a great help here.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_radiance_field">neural radiance fields</a> (NeRFs) lately and thought a fun way to explore them would be flying through them in the Treekeepers “Puddle Jumper” in true scale.</p>

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QguH3aK90Ck?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Of course, you lose a lot of the draw of NeRFs when you export the model into a 3d engine because it has to flatten all the textures and lighting, and also Luma AI cuts off 3D model exports as a jarring cube</p>
<p>But still - I was amazed at how well just applying a day/night lighting cycle and mesh colliders worked with this. Projectile and enemy physics played well too.</p>
<p>It’s still early days, but I could see 3D model generation from this tech getting a lot better and forming the basis for some really interesting user-generated content in the future!</p>
<p>Neat stuff - big thanks to Luma AI for the free toolset.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Flapper&rdquo; is a project that spawned out of a simple VR movement mechanic test that I had had in my head for a while, which turned out to be surprisingly fun! The idea is to flap your arms to fly - and have it be a multiplayer battle to really get people moving.</p>
<p>In order to start working on this game, because there was so much standard VR code that I had to write for tree keepers, I decided to make a sort of engine out of tree keepers and work off of that rather than start from scratch. That let me tie in some of the nice associated graphics, music and sound effects I had made, and a bunch of other helper functions and things I use for things like the camera following around the character, how I deal with collisions, a bunch of netcode, etc.</p>
<p>You can see my more detailed post about that engine here: <a href="/treekeepers-engine">Treekeepers Engine</a></p>
<h2 id="core-mechanic--gameplay">Core Mechanic &amp; Gameplay</h2>
<p>Most of the start of this game was just tuning the movement mechanic, which borrowed from some physics realities and some elements I made up to make flapping feel good. But, the essential idea was that each arm would generate unique thrust in the direction it was moving with an exponenthel applied to how fast it was moving. It&rsquo;s hard to describe any native VR mechanic with words and videos only, but to me and the folks I demoed it to; it felt &ldquo;right&rdquo; for how flying should work if you did it by flapping your arms. I had a ton of fun just jetting around the obstacle courses I made for myself.</p>
<p>My idea for this other than just the mechanic was to make a sort of gorilla tag-esque multiplayer game where players would fly around and try to pop each other&rsquo;s balloons in a NES balloon fight {link} style. Ideally something like 15 to 20 people would be in a lobby flying around and trying to pop each other.</p>
<p>Like gorilla tag I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to have to &ldquo;sit out&rdquo; of the game, so it&rsquo;s essentially a deathmatch where the player who pops the most balloons wins, and is also visible who&rsquo;s winning, because they also gain the balloons that they pop. In some playtests players would have 20 or 30 balloons on their head. This was my clever idea of adding a built-in rubber-band effect to the gameplay as well, since having more balloons over your head made you a bigger target to pop. The gameplay worked well - but I never quite got the game to a place with netcode and networking engine where multiplayer felt seamless enough.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of one of the later states of the game, where I have it fully networked and am testing with friends, though it still has a few bugs here:</p>

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vxn8rDOZ7dU?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>I stopped working on this project after about 3 months. It turned out that flying alone with this mechanic was very compelling (and also a great workout!) but the networking engine I had used for Teeekeepers, Photon, was not up to task for how low latency a competitive game needed to be. Treekeepers was four-player co-op so photon was just fine.</p>
<p>In the future I might pick this one back up (or maybe have an AI agent pick it up for me depending on how that goes) using space-time DB {link}</p>
<p>which looks like a great solution for this type of game that doesn&rsquo;t require a whole ton of cloud programming and setup.</p>

<p>Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.</p>
<p>Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the <a href="https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/">Treekeepers VR Website</a> for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.</p>
<p>I initially designed the project for SteamVR only using the SteamVR SDK but quickly realized that a VR game released only on PC would miss the majority of the userbase, as the (then Oculus) Quest 2 was quickly dominating the market. Treekeepers was a good fit for a mobile platform with its simple low-poly cel-shaded design, so I pivoted to using OpenXR about two months into the project to support VR interactions on both PC and mobile (Android) devices like the Quest 2.</p>
<p>By summer 2022, I had a releasable product, albeit only with one “world” available. I decided to push the game to early access to gather rapid feedback from real players, and after getting approved for both storefronts, Treekeepers released to early access on September 30, 2022.</p>

<p>Editor&rsquo;s note from 2025:</p>
<p>This article was written as part of the launch of Treekeepers VR and the sole proprietorship Together Again Studios, and represents some of my core beliefs of the value of VR and where it&rsquo;s taking us socially. Though I&rsquo;m no longer actively working on Treekeepers, I do hold that VR and AR are truly the &ldquo;endgame&rdquo; of interface and one that could save us from some of the social attitudes caused by social media of today.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<h3 id="with-together-again-studios-and-treekeepers-vr-were-setting-out-to-solve-an-insidious-problem-we-see-all-around-us">With Together Again Studios and Treekeepers VR, we&rsquo;re setting out to solve an insidious problem we see all around us:</h3>
<h4 id="social-media-is-anti-social">Social Media Is Anti-Social</h4>
<p>Though Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok all let us share more with each other than ever before, what we are sharing is surprisingly hostile and dismissive of opinions other than our own.</p>
<p>Though Zoom, Hangouts and Teams let us finally see each other from a distance, we still can&rsquo;t speak naturally. We depend on tools like &ldquo;mute&rdquo;. We create meeting upon meeting with different sets of the same group of people. And we don&rsquo;t form the depth of relationships we could in-person.</p>
<p>We as humans are all-too-capable of forming us-versus-them &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; and dehumanizing those who appear too different, and this problem is becoming ever more apparent behind the curtain of the graphical user interface.</p>
<h4 id="virtual-and-augmented-reality-are-a-way-out">Virtual and augmented reality are a way out</h4>
<p>In 2016, thanks to pioneers like Palmer Luckey, Michael Abrash, and John Carmack, we suddenly gained access to a technology that removes the curtain and forces us to see eachother. And in 2020, an event that has permanently limited our in-person interaction arose and gave new meaning to this technology.</p>
<p>In VR/AR, voices are no longer text on a screen, taken out of context by our social media bubbles. They&rsquo;re voices again.</p>
<p>In VR/AR, people are no longer user profiles with one image and a tag-line. They&rsquo;re really people, with bodies, faces, and hands that can point and gesture.</p>
<p>In VR/AR, messages are not just &ldquo;public&rdquo;, or &ldquo;direct&rdquo;. Conversations are dynamic, with people physically approaching one another to talk, with people moving in and out of physical groups, and with people attending public conversations together again while still able to have &ldquo;sidebar&rdquo; conversations.</p>
<p>All these abilities we used to have in-person, we have gained again in virtual reality.</p>
<p>Soon, we&rsquo;ll go even further with this technology. We&rsquo;ll be able to make real eye contact with eachother in VR. We&rsquo;ll use AR to invite distant friends and family over to our homes.</p>
<p>And at Together Again, we plan on using these new tools to let people like eachother again.</p>
<h3 id="treekeepers-only-possible-in-vr">Treekeepers: Only Possible in VR</h3>
<p>Why is Treekeepers a VR Game?</p>
<h4 id="multiplayer-of-this-depth-only-works-in-vr">Multiplayer of this depth only works in VR</h4>
<p>The challenges in Treekeepers VR hinge on player coordination and quick group decisions - Which weapon should we upgrade? Who&rsquo;s doing which job? Where are we going?</p>
<p>In VR, you gain the ability to gesture and point to enemies and obstacles naturally.</p>
<p>No more &ldquo;Who is the green player?&rdquo; - spend zero mental energy figuring out who you are talking to. Just turn towards them and speak.</p>
<h4 id="scale-is-the-most-fun-when-youre-in-the-world">Scale is the most fun when you&rsquo;re in the world</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be exploring oversized objects around a gigantic tree. Only VR can get the full benefit of this experience.</p>
<h4 id="vr-can-be-uncomfortable">VR can be uncomfortable</h4>
<p>BUT, experiencing it via a static vehicle which acts as a persistent frame of reference reduces motion sickness.</p>
<p>No need to rotate - gameplay is based on the hot air balloon always facing one direction, and players navigating within it.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Land War is an 8-player strategy game I developed as a solo project and released to Steam in March of 2019.<br>
This game was intended to have low art requirements and simple interaction rules that result in deep strategic gameplay.</p>
<p>The core concept is that of an ultra-simplified real-time-strategy game. Each player is represented by a color and can grow their territory by moving in any direction. The strategic elements occur when players encounter other players and have to make choices about which side of their land to defend or give up. Players can use the structure of the map and the coordinated action of other players to gain defensible footholds in order to take more area and eventually be the last player on the board.</p>

<p>A full game of the final product released on Steam played on a Windows computer.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>I built Land War over the course of 7 months and 400 hours of work using Unity with C#. Though art requirements were intentionally low for a video game, I still had to produce several hundred static graphics and GIFs, and commissioned custom music for the menu and gameplay.</p>
<p>This project is one of my favorite examples of what can be done in relatively little time with a focused vision and a constant eye on scope creep. From the very start, I knew that a key to making compelling software was to flesh out the core concept before all else. This is why I started on the most fundamental strategic interaction of the players and built an MVP version of the game without a menu, sound, art, or even a win condition.</p>
<p>I started the project on a Memorial Day Monday, and by Friday had a rudimentary prototype playable with 8 players on Nintendo Joy-Con controllers paired to a Windows machine via Bluetooth.<br>
This is what the project looked like for my first play-test with other people 5 days in:</p>

<p>From there, I continued to work on depth and full feature functionality including menus, a tutorial, a map generator, a dynamic scoring and round system, better sound and sprite graphics, different play modes and settings, and support for many controllers. I released the game with very little marketing aside from some Reddit posts and a physical handout at E3 but was happy to receive positive reviews and several hundred purchases of the game.</p>
