                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="/about-me">Brian Hockenmaier</a>, and this site is full of things I build and write about. I love making games and things with VR and AI. And I love DIY projects, especially ones involving programming, engineering and 3D modeling. Some of this has been cross or back-posted from my <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/hockenmaier/designs">thingiverse</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier">github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hockenmaier/">linkedin</a>, and other places, but it all lives here permanently.</p>
<p>This is an evolution of <a href="old-site/index.html">my previous site last updated in 2022, which I still keep inside this one</a> for posterity and for the AIs of the future to know more about me. I like it not because of the content as much as because it was a fully custom js and html site with no framework&hellip; and I think it&rsquo;s sort of fun and funny that it was like this.</p>
<p>All work and opinions here are my own, not my employer&rsquo;s.</p>
<h1 id="why-im-making-it">Why I&rsquo;m making it</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m creating this website in 2025 after starting a family as well as my first full-time role in AI. It&rsquo;s an effort to clean up my website&rsquo;s focus, move several disparate collections into one place, and emphasize what I truly care about. I wanted it to be easier to add content, CMS style, and I wanted a space to occasionally post written content, too.</p>

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">This webpage, if you hadn&#39;t noticed</span>
    
</div>

<p>A big reason I&rsquo;m doing this now is that, after listening to the Dwarkesh podcast with Gwern, I was convinced I really should have more of a record for future AIs to learn about me. I really don’t have a social media presence, nor do I want one, and over the years I have had a lot of projects and writing that I have unnecessarily kept private. AGI or not, there are non-artificial intelligences that may be interested one day. Talking to you, Alice :) When I started this website, your cousin Lily kept asking where you were and didn&rsquo;t seem to get the concept that you currently occupied the same space as Kaitlin.</p>
<p>I love some of the 2010s era blogs, and though mine is not going to be nearly as longform, nearly as focused on prose, or nearly as articulate, two of the sites I&rsquo;m trying to take inspiration from are <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/about/">Slate Star Codex</a> and <a href="https://gwern.net/about">Gwern&rsquo;s website</a> which are definitely advising on style here. Other than the fact that mine is also a game.</p>

<h1 id="etymology-of-hockenworks">Etymology of &ldquo;hockenworks&rdquo;</h1>
<p><strong>Hockenmaier</strong> is a great name. I&rsquo;ve always loved it. Not just because it’s unique and has my favorite number of letters, but because of its meaning, at least my family’s “folk-etymology” for it.</p>
<p>You have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hocken</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which can roughly translate to “sitting down, squatting, settling, idling”.</p>
<p>And then you have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Maier</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which has many different spellings, and ours has southern German roots, but all &ldquo;Meyer&rdquo; names come from the latin root &ldquo;maior&rdquo; meaning steward, administrator, or more generally &ldquo;worker&rdquo;</p>
<p>My family often puts these two ideas together as &ldquo;Lazy Worker,&rdquo; which is very on-brand for our sense of humor, but I think it&rsquo;s not just funny, but true.</p>
<p>“Lazy Worker” is perfect for someone who wants to get a lot done, especially in software engineering. We only have so many hours, and the best lives are lived restricting the number of hours spent on work that isn&rsquo;t done with people you love. So you better be efficient about it. You better be lazy. There are <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">many</a> <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">correct</a> <a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/">takes</a> out there on the value of being lazy when programming.</p>
<p>Now that we are starting to have AI, it&rsquo;s even better. A lazy worker like myself will not only avoid unnecessary work, but will delegate all that can be delegated to the new AI workers that are multiplying in our computers. That makes the &ldquo;steward&rdquo; connotation of &ldquo;Maier&rdquo; all the more fitting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to be the lazy worker, and this site is all about sharing my lazy works. My <em>hockenworks</em>.</p>

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The Ball Machine</span>
    
</div>

<p>Most blogs and personal websites are a bit boring. I think that is because most professionals consider what they do &ldquo;for work&rdquo; a bit boring by its nature, and don&rsquo;t necessarily make a concerted effort to have fun with it.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be the opposite, and with kids coming I am trying to make a bigger effort than ever to have fun whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Which is often working, in some way or another.</p>
<p>So for my website, I wanted it to be intentionally fun. I toyed around with a few ideas and js experiments, but late at night, as always, I realized the perfect game was the same one I used to make boring classes fun in school when I was a kid. That game consisted of the book of graph paper I always kept with me, plus a pencil, a ruler, and a protractor. I was a bit obsessed with physics simulation at the time. My favorite game in church growing up, where I was often daydreaming and looking at the huge arched ceiling, was to imagine a laser coming out of my line of sight and bouncing off of every surface in the room, to see where it would end up. This graph paper game I played was similar.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Some of my early playtests got pretty chaotic</span>
    
</div>

<p>I would start by making a &ldquo;spawn point&rdquo; usually near the top left of the page, where balls would start falling. I would draw out the path of these balls a few inches from each other along their path with &ldquo;speed lines&rdquo; to denote which way they were going, and how fast. Then I would add platforms, trampolines, loops, curves, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; acceleration zones, jumps, machines that would disassemble and reassemble balls, and so many other things - usually something new each sheet of paper - and I would end up with a Rube Goldberg machine of balls flying all around the sheet. The only goal was to fill the sheet with more ridiculous paths.</p>
<p>I started calling the sheets my &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo;. I wish I still had some of these drawings. I remember them being quite intricate.. I must have reserved English class for them.</p>
<p>So, to honor kid Brian, I am making my website a permanent ball machine. I hope you have fun with it and see all there is to unlock!</p>

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Even on the limited phone version, you can create some productive chaos</span>
    
</div>

<h2 id="how-its-made">How it&rsquo;s made</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t typically make complicated things like this with JavaScript. So when I found the perfect physics engine for the game - <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a> - I knew I would need help from our new little assistants. And though this game is a bit too structured to call it &ldquo;vibe coded&rdquo; - at times, it was close.</p>
<p>I ended up making my own tool called <a href="/context-caddy">Context Caddy</a> to help me with it. Part of the reason I leaned so hard into this is because I&rsquo;m always trying to push the limits of current AI, and I hadn&rsquo;t built a game since the GPT-4 days (I&rsquo;ll post about that soon). The new thinking models are truly a step above GPT-4 (this was mostly done with o3 and its minis) but they&rsquo;re still way too eager to write duplicate code, and they still don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; the structure of your project a lot of the time, especially with visual and physical things like this. Still, they were a great help here.</p>
<p>This game is made extra complicated by the fact that it runs on top of <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which is the static site generator behind the &ldquo;content&rdquo; part of this site. This probably doubled or tripled the effort of making this game. But, the balls in the &ldquo;ball machines&rdquo; of my youth would interact with my text notes and drawings, so this ball machine needed to do so as well.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit going on under the hood to make these two very distinct types of development projects work in tandem, and for both of them to work well. The Ball Machine would love to eat up all of the resources and make the site content unresponsive, and the content was quite a lot to dynamically build physical bodies and colliders around. I like the end result. But I like it a lot better on desktop, where the two can really interact, so I think you should play it on a real computer with a mouse.</p>

    This tube creates balls every time you click it
  </span>
  
</span>

<p>The ball machine on this site is a gamified version of my graph paper drawings as a kid. Each time you load a page, you&rsquo;ll see a little pneumatic delivery tube on the top right of the screen.</p>
<p>When you spawn your first ball, you&rsquo;ll see a few things appear. First - you&rsquo;ll find a goal     <span
  style="

</span>
 somewhere randomly on the page. Find a way to get the balls you spawn into that goal. But there is a bit of a trick - balls start out being worth 1 coin and accumulate another coin in value every two seconds. So, the longer you can keep balls around, the more they will be worth when going into the goals, and this might get more and more challenging as your drawings take up more of the screen and balls start bouncing off of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Clicking!</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game">a clicker game</a> - start by manually clicking the pneumatic delivery tube to spawn balls, but as you accumulate coins you&rsquo;ll be able to unlock different drawables and things that will let you accumulate more coins faster. If it feels like it&rsquo;s taking a while to make coins and unlock things, try playing around more with how the balls interact with the content, and use all of the tools you can draw. The site also works across multiple pages. And if all else fails&hellip; just give it time. This is a clicker game after all, so waiting is always a strategy! There is plenty to read while you wait.</p>
<p>It works best when you&rsquo;re on desktop, working on one tab at a time.</p>

<strong>You get what you pay for&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>If you ever find yourself out of money, these dotted lines are free. They are not saved permanently like other lines and they go away after 50 balls hit them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>❌ A couple of things to watch out for when building ball machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balls have to be moving at all times. If they sit still for too long, they are considered dead and will poof out of existence.</li>
<li>This applies to balls hitting the goal, too. If your balls aren&rsquo;t moving much when they hit the target, they won&rsquo;t go in.
So keep your balls moving!</li>
</ul>
<p>😵 If you have a good run going, but it descends into chaos, it can be hard to recover. That&rsquo;s what the <kbd>Erase Balls</kbd> button above the draw tools is for!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each post on this site will be a slightly different randomized game! Try making ball machines on multiple pages at once. Your work will be saved in realtime, and you can make money even on pages you&rsquo;re not currently playing on.</p>

 These counters display how much <strong>sustainable</strong> coin revenue per second you&rsquo;re making on this page, and how much other pages you&rsquo;re not currently working on are contributing. Any balls that are spawned automatically and continuously travel through your contraption to hit the goal will be averaged into the top amount. When you visit other pages, you will keep making this money - that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;Other Pages&rdquo; revenue displays.</p>
<p>Your progress is saved to your device because your contraptions will be highly dependent on the screen size the site renders to.</p>
<p>The game works a bit differently on desktop and mobile, and the best experience is really on desktop - so try on a computer if you can! If on mobile, flip to landscape.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-game">The End of the Game</h3>
<p>Right now, the Ball Machine doesn&rsquo;t end, but you will be surprised the amount of money you can make across the whole site! Eventually, there will be other ways to spend coins on this site and potentially &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the ball machine. The late game items change the game in very interesting ways! I hope you make some fun machines on my website.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s a peek at my first major board game creation!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few clones or slight enhancements of games I like before like <a href="/nope-game">Nope</a> and <a href="/hocken-pocket-blokus">Hocken-Pocket-Blokus</a>, but Bloom or Bust is my first attempt at something of my own design with very high production quality.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The Cast</span>
    
</div>

<p>This is a risk-taking game where players compete to take over a tree with their specific type of fruit. Trees and bees are becoming a recurring theme in my games!</p>
<p>All parts of this game are hand-designed by me, mostly in VR with a tool called Gravity Sketch, blender, and one of my favorite programmer&rsquo;s 3D tools called OpenSCAD.</p>
<div class="paige-row-wide">

<p>Of all my models, this one takes most advantage of my multicolor BambuLab printer. All parts including the custom box which cleverly incorporates the instructions and game board itself are printed in BambuLab Matte PLA, which in my opinion is the most beautiful way to print.</p>
<p>Production is batched with 80 to 150 of each fruit or bee on a build plate, with overall production heavily limited by the game board and latching box each requiring a separate print.</p>
<div class="paige-row-wide">
  <div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:repeat(2, minmax(0,1fr)); gap:15px;">

<p>I have looked into outsourcing production of this game so that I can actually distribute it, but that has not happened yet. Its design is totally dependent on multicolor 3D printing, and most print farms would require nearly $30 just to produce it, let alone shipping it and any margin. Injection molding is an option but also gets expensive with this level of detailed color, and requires remodeling in several significant ways. It still might happen. Or I might put it out on a site that lets people buy the model and print it themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post in the future about how I decide to distribute this. If you really want to buy one now, contact me - but as of now I need to charge about $100 for a set.</p>

This one is super simple. Give it what you’ve written and it will provide no-BS proofreads. It’s not going to hallucinate content, just point out mistakes and parts that don’t make sense.</p>

<p>Make Real (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Hw8qvqqey-make-real)">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Hw8qvqqey-make-real)</a>:
This makes your napkin drawings into working websites. It’s got some of the same limitations other code-generating AI tools do, but it does a surprisingly good job creating simple working web frontends for your ideas!</p>
<p>Postman for PMs (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms</a>)
Talk to APIs using natural language instead of downloading technical tools or writing code (only unauthenticated APIs, for now). Also a great way to learn about APIs for newbies - Postman for PMs knows about some free online APIs to get started with.</p>
<p>The Boy (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-efYNPIDrz-the-boy">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-efYNPIDrz-the-boy</a>)
An experimental “AI generated RPG” where you play as “The Boy” who realizes fantastic superpowers. It’s fun to play around and explore, but don’t expect too much consistent gameplay from the currently available AI models.</p>
<p>Exciting times. Have fun!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Custom GPT&rdquo; - a customized version of chatGPT. Just give it some details about the API and then tell it in English what you want to get, post, update, whatever.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a PM, business analyst, or anyone that cares about APIs but doesn&rsquo;t like terminals and engineer-y tools like Postman, and you have ChatGPT plus, try it out. Here&rsquo;s a link:
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QeNbSmirA-postman-for-pms</a></p>
<p>Important disclaimer: DON&rsquo;T use ChatGPT on corporate stuff if your company doesn&rsquo;t allow it! This was a fun experiment for me and I&rsquo;m definitely not using any corporate resources on it/for it. There are plenty of free APIs to try this out on. Maybe ask ChatGPT for some suggestions</p>

<h2 id="hocken-pocket-blokus-print-instructions">Hocken-Pocket-Blokus Print Instructions</h2>
<p>If you have a multi-filament printer, check out the new 3mf for &ldquo;Hocken Pocket Blokus&rdquo; - a self contained full blokus game and box with a hinged lid, and game instructions printed into the box.</p>
<p>You can also print the lid and box STLs separately, but if you choose to do that, remember: the pocket version that the box and lid are made for requires scaling the board and pieces: X scaled to 70%, Y scaled to 70% and Z scaled to 115%.</p>
<h2 id="original-print-instructions">Original Print Instructions</h2>
<p>To print the board, print 4 of the &ldquo;Playing Board Quarter&rdquo; file. These should have the right level of tolerance to fit snugly but not too tight.</p>
<p>To print the pieces, you can either use the full plate set of 21 pieces, or pick and choose from the individual files. The file names represent the number of squares in each piece, as well as a word description of what the piece looks like.</p>
<p>Make sure the board and all sets of pieces are distinct colors of plastic.</p>
<p>Here is a link on how to play the game:</p>

<p>It was super fun returning to this project! I was able to fix a few things that I had noticed failing over the years, like the new reinforced sides to the &ldquo;? Block&rdquo; holder. Now that multi-color prints are proliferating more widely, I&rsquo;m hoping people can use the new colored files - they really pop with the Silk+Matte PLA combo I used here.

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post retrospectively as I never published it at the time of creation. It will live here as a &ldquo;stake in the ground&rdquo; of AI software capabilities as of March 2023. Note- if you&rsquo;re reading on substack, this post won&rsquo;t work. Go to <a href="hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system/">hockenworks.com/gpt-4-solar-system</a>.</p>
<p>The interactive solar system below was created with minimal help from me, by the very first version of GPT-4, before even function calling was a feature. It was the first of an ongoing series of experiments to see what frontier models could do by themselves - and I&rsquo;m posting it here because it was the earliest example I saved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the chat where it was created, though it&rsquo;s not possible to continue this conversation directly since the model involved has long since been deprecated: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387">https://chatgpt.com/share/683b5680-8ac8-8006-9493-37add8749387</a></p>

<div style="width:100%; max-width:1000px; margin:1em auto; position:relative; padding-top:70%;">
  <iframe
    src="/html/solar-system-self-contained.html"
    style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:1px solid #ccc;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">GPT-4 only wrote this for desktop, sorry phone users</span>
    
</div>

<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Click + Drag</kbd> to move the solar system around</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Up</kbd> to zoom in from the cursor location</p>
<p><kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd> to zoom out</p>
<p>If you get lost, reload the page. That&rsquo;s an edge case GPT-4 didn&rsquo;t account for :)</p>
<p>Here was the initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be a long output, so if you need to break and I&rsquo;ll ask you to continue in another message feel free to do that. But please limit any non-code text prose to only essential statements to help mitigate this</p>
<p>I want you to make me a dynamic website. It should look good on mobile or on desktop, and I would like you to pick a nice dark background color and an interesting font to use across the page.</p>
<p>The page is intended to show the scale of the solar system in an interactive way, primarily designed for children to zoom in and out of different parts of the solar system and see planets and the Sun in relative scale. Mouse controls should also include panning around the model solar system, and should include text around planets with some statistics about their size, gravity, atmospheres, and any other fun facts you think would be educational and fun for 10-12 year olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I had to give it 4 more short prompts, one for a technical hint (to use html-5 since it was going a strange direction) and 3 for visual and mouse control misses.</p>
<p>It works - but missed some of the relatively simple directions, like the planet stats and rendering/controls for mobile. Still, I think it&rsquo;s cool to see the true scale of the planets on a zoomable canvas. And, it only goes to Neptune, the last true planet&hellip; don&rsquo;t go looking for Pluto.</p>
<p>For March 2023, this result was revolutionary - I was truly impressed. In 2025, it&rsquo;s not very impressive at all. How quickly we get used to progress!</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I made my latest Unity project into a multi-application &ldquo;engine&rdquo;. I am now building and releasing two applications from one project. Let me show you how it works.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Switching apps in the treekeepers engine"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/treekeepers-app-switcher-1.gif"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Switching apps in the treekeepers engine</span>
    
</div>

<p>I did this because I had a lot of assets and code in Treekeepers that would directly translate to a new project I was prototyping. I considered other approaches - git submodules, unity packages, just cloning my old project. After a cost-benefit writeup I decided on this.</p>
<p>Now when I change variables, I edit a class called “Application Definition” for each application, which look like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="An applictaion definition in the editor"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/treekeepers-app-switcher-2.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 400px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>My plan is to use this new &ldquo;Engine project&rdquo; to not only update multiple games with common assets and code easily, but also as an instant starting point for any new networked VR/AR prototype.</p>
<p>As I go, any code I refactor to be generic across all projects goes in an Engine folder. Same for prefabs, materials, etc.</p>
<p>This way, if this gets cumbersome in the future, I can make a git submodule out of everything in &ldquo;Engine&rdquo; and import that into a new project.</p>
<p>Here are the scripts. The first runs via the Editor UI and takes variables for anything that needs to be different by project. The second file has the application definition classes you saw in the image above.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/hockenmaier/14d50ff0bb90aece1cc6de1b9fc5419d">https://gist.github.com/hockenmaier/14d50ff0bb90aece1cc6de1b9fc5419d</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/hockenmaier/14d50ff0bb90aece1cc6de1b9fc5419d.js"></script>

<p>The files are free to use. Check them out if you&rsquo;re in a similar situation, but be warned there are still some hard-coded things and references you’ll need to change.</p>
<p>Has anyone taken this approach before? Curious on other&rsquo;s take or approaches to similar problems!</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_radiance_field">neural radiance fields</a> (NeRFs) lately and thought a fun way to explore them would be flying through them in the Treekeepers “Puddle Jumper” in true scale.</p>

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

    </div>

<p>Of course, you lose a lot of the draw of NeRFs when you export the model into a 3d engine because it has to flatten all the textures and lighting, and also Luma AI cuts off 3D model exports as a jarring cube</p>
<p>But still - I was amazed at how well just applying a day/night lighting cycle and mesh colliders worked with this. Projectile and enemy physics played well too.</p>
<p>It’s still early days, but I could see 3D model generation from this tech getting a lot better and forming the basis for some really interesting user-generated content in the future!</p>
<p>Neat stuff - big thanks to Luma AI for the free toolset.</p>]]></description>

</div>

<p>Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.</p>
<p>Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the <a href="https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/">Treekeepers VR Website</a> for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.</p>
<p>I initially designed the project for SteamVR only using the SteamVR SDK but quickly realized that a VR game released only on PC would miss the majority of the userbase, as the (then Oculus) Quest 2 was quickly dominating the market. Treekeepers was a good fit for a mobile platform with its simple low-poly cel-shaded design, so I pivoted to using OpenXR about two months into the project to support VR interactions on both PC and mobile (Android) devices like the Quest 2.</p>
<p>By summer 2022, I had a releasable product, albeit only with one “world” available. I decided to push the game to early access to gather rapid feedback from real players, and after getting approved for both storefronts, Treekeepers released to early access on September 30, 2022.</p>]]></description>

<p>A demo of the human joystick movement system, showing how the system can work on flat surfaces or terrain.</p>
<p>This was my first barebones VR project. Though I knew Unity going in, VR and 3D games in general have a lot of unique aspects that I wanted to learn about while trying to solve an actual problem, rather than following tutorials or demos online.</p>
<p>VR has some adoption problems in its current state. We all know of some of the main problems- the clunky headset, the nausea issues, and of course the pricetag. But one major problem that you don&rsquo;t really notice until you get into it, is the lack of a good solution for virtual movement.</p>
<p>I had been wondering about &ldquo;the human joystick&rdquo; as a potential a solution to this particular problem ever since getting into consumer VR in 2016.</p>
<p>In most modern VR systems, the player can move physically around the room if they choose. Some applications and games depend on this - they put you in a small space and rely on your physical movement in order to reach different areas and interact with things. But games that provide a more traditional sense of scale and allow players to move through large worlds cannot rely on physical motion, because their users are constrained by physical space. Because of this, you see all kinds of &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; locomotion systems in order to let people move around - some just like traditional 2D games that let users &ldquo;slide&rdquo; their playspaces around the world using a joystick, and others that adopt teleportation mechanics. Neither feel very natural as compared to actually walking, and some can be downright sickening.</p>
<p>My goal with this project was to solve this problem with a mixture of physical and artificial movement.</p>
<p>It works like this: When the player is standing near the center of their playspace, physical VR movement applies. The player can move around and interact with things with their actual bodies. But once the player moves further from the center, the plaspace starts to move with them in the same direction as the vector from the center of the player&rsquo;s space to their current position. This allows for some of the benefits that physical movement experiences have, while allowing the players to more naturally move through an infinite amount of space.</p>
<p>I experimented with several speeds, both static and scaling with the distance between the center and the player. I also experimented with the size of the physical movement &ldquo;deadzone&rdquo; and with vertical and constrained movement across hills, valleys, and buildings.</p>

<hr>
<p>Eventually I found some good default values and the system worked, but there were some unforeseen problems: First, it was more difficult to center yourself within the playspace without looking at the visible guides I put at the player&rsquo;s feet than I expected. Second and more importantly, when you were already moving in one direction, it was not as simple as I thought to start moving in another direction accurately without fully returning to center, which was an immersion breaker.</p>
<p>Ultimately I put the project up for others to view but have not expanded it into a full experience or released it on any marketplaces. Feel free to download the Unity project and try it on your own VR setup if you&rsquo;re curious.</p>]]></description>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Answering Machine is a proof-of-concept system that I built using <strong>pre-LLM</strong> natural language processing (NLP), specifically NLTK, to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>Looking back, this project was a great insight into what LLMs immediately allowed that was incredibly difficult before. This project was several months of work that the openAI sdk would probably have allowed in a few weeks - and that few weeks would have been mostly frontend design and a bit of prompting.</p>
<p><strong>Try it here:</strong> <a href="http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">http://voicequery-dev.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/</a>
<strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery">https://github.com/hockenmaier/voicequery</a></p>
<p>The system uses natural language processing to produce answers to questions asked about data in plain English.</p>
<p>It is designed with simplicity in mind—upload any columnar dataset and start asking questions and getting answers. It uses advanced NLP algorithms to make assumptions about what data you&rsquo;re asking about and lets you correct those assumptions for follow-up questions if they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It is built entirely out of serverless components, which means there is no cost to maintain or run it other than the traffic the system receives.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How-to</h2>
<p>On a desktop or tablet, click the link in the header to navigate to the Answering Machine. For now, it isn&rsquo;t optimized for smartphone-sized screens.</p>
<p>In order to use the Answering Machine, you can either select one of the existing datasets, such as &ldquo;HR Activity Sample,&rdquo; or upload one of your own using the homepage of the site:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine homepage"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_uploads.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>To upload your own, click in the upload area or just drag a file straight from your desktop. For now, use CSV data files. Excel and other spreadsheet programs can easily save data in the CSV format using the &ldquo;File &gt; Save As&rdquo; or similar option in the menu. Each file needs a unique name.</p>
<p>When you hit the upload button, the site may not appear to change until the file is uploaded, at which point you&rsquo;ll see it appear in the box labeled &ldquo;Ask Your Data Anything&rdquo; below. Click on your file to start using it with the Answering Machine, or click the red trash can icon to delete it.</p>
<p>There are no user accounts in this system yet, so the data you upload might be seen by other users using the system. Try not to use sensitive data for now.</p>
<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h3>
<p>When you enter a dataset, you&rsquo;ll see a view that presents you with quite a bit of information:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    







    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine main view"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_hr.png"   style="height: auto; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The only part you need to focus on right now is the information panel. This panel lists out all the fields (columns), data types of those fields, and some sample data from a few records in your dataset:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine info panel"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_info.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>You can use this panel to start to formulate questions you might have about the data. If you see number values, you might ask about averages, maximums, or other math that might otherwise take some time to calculate. If you see a date, you can ask questions about the data in certain time periods.</p>
<p>Many datasets also contain fields that only have a few specific allowed values. When the Answering Machine sees fewer than 15 unique values in any field, the data type will be a &ldquo;List&rdquo; and it lists them right out under the sample values table. You can use this type of value to ask questions about records containing those specific values. For example, in the HR dataset, you might only be interested in data where the &ldquo;Education&rdquo; field&rsquo;s value is &ldquo;High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now look to the query bar to start asking your data questions:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine query bar"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_query.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The types of questions that will currently be automatically detected and answered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts of records where certain conditions are true</li>
<li>Math questions such as averages, medians, maximums, and minimums</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of questions can be made specific by using qualifying statements with prepositional phrases like &ldquo;in 2019&rdquo; or adjective phrases like &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;entry-level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Combining these two ideas, you can ask specific questions with any number of qualifiers, such as:<br>
<em>&ldquo;What was the median salary of male employees in the engineering department 5 years ago?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Upon hitting the &ldquo;Ask&rdquo; button (or hitting Enter), the Answering Machine will do its best to answer your question and will show you all of its work in this format:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine response"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_answer.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 720px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>The last line in the response is the Answering Machine&rsquo;s answer. In this case, it is telling you the metric you asked for with all your stipulations is <strong>6871.6 dollars.</strong></p>
<p>Moving up, you see a series of assessments that the Answering Machine has made in order to filter and identify the data you are asking about. Statements like &ldquo;Best auto-detected Numeric Subject Found: salary with column: Compensation (Monthly)&rdquo; provide a glimpse into one of the Answering Machine&rsquo;s most advanced features, which uses a selection of NLP techniques to compare words and phrases that are similar in meaning, ultimately matching things you are asking about to fields and values that actually exist in your database.</p>
<p>At the very top of the response is how the Answering Machine&rsquo;s nested grammar parsing logic actually parsed your question, with some specific pieces color-coded:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> chunks indicate &ldquo;subjects&rdquo; that were detected. Subjects are what the Answering Machine thinks you&rsquo;re asking &ldquo;about.&rdquo; These should represent both the main subject and other supporting subjects in your question.</li>
<li><strong>Purple</strong> chunks are conditions. These are the things that the Answering Machine thinks you are trying to use to &ldquo;specify&rdquo; or filter data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that your question is answered, you might notice that some new green and purple colored bubbles have appeared in the sections of your screen labeled &ldquo;New Subjects&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Conditions.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo;:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine subjects and conditions"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_lexicon.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 400px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<h3 id="forming-concepts">Forming Concepts</h3>
<p>If the Answering Machine already understood what you were asking and successfully matched it to fields and values in your data, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything with these. But often you will be using domain-specific lexicon, or the auto-matching algorithm simply won&rsquo;t pick the correct value. These situations are what concepts are for.</p>
<p>To create a concept, click and drag on the green or purple &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo; bubble and move it out into the blank middle area of the screen. Then click and drag the field or field value from the info-panel at the top of the screen and drop it right on top of that bubble. You&rsquo;ll see both the data bubble and the lexicon bubble included in a larger gray bubble, which represents the concept:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    




























    



    



    





    



    





    



    






















<img  alt="Answering Machine concept"   crossorigin="anonymous"    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  src="https://hockenworks.com/images/answering_machine_concept.png"   style="height: auto; max-width: 200px; width: 100%"   >


    
</div>

<p>You can add more lexicon bubbles to this concept if they mean the same thing, but you can only use one data bubble.</p>
<p>Concepts override the Answering Machine&rsquo;s auto-matching logic. If you ask another question containing a subject or condition that is now matched by a user to a data value, that data value will be used instead of the auto-match. If the concept isn&rsquo;t working well, you can delete it by dragging all of the nested bubbles out of it either into the blank middle area or into the colored panel they originally came from.</p>
<p>Feel free to play around with new datasets and questions, and use the contact section of this site if you have comments or questions. When you ask questions or create/modify concepts, that data will automatically be saved to the server in real-time. You can close the page anytime and come back to your dataset to keep asking questions.</p>
<p>Remember that there are no user accounts, meaning you can share your dataset and work in tandem with others! But again, please do not upload sensitive data to this proof-of-concept tool as it will be available for other users to see and query.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The Answering Machine is a purely &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; application, meaning that there is no server hosting the various components of the application until those components are needed by a user. This is true for the database, the file storage, the static website, the backend compute, and the API orchestration.</p>
<p>For the cloud nerds out there, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">here is a great article</a> by Martin Fowler on what exactly &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; means, especially in terms of the backend compute portion, which is arguably the most valuable part of the application to be serverless. For reference, I am using Martin&rsquo;s 2nd definition of &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; here.</p>
<p>This is a high-level map of all of the components that make the Answering Machine work in its current (June 2020) state. The API gateways, CloudWatch events, and some triggers &ldquo;given for free&rdquo; by AWS are left out of this for readability:</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Land War is an 8-player strategy game I developed as a solo project and released to Steam in March of 2019.<br>
This game was intended to have low art requirements and simple interaction rules that result in deep strategic gameplay.</p>
<p>The core concept is that of an ultra-simplified real-time-strategy game. Each player is represented by a color and can grow their territory by moving in any direction. The strategic elements occur when players encounter other players and have to make choices about which side of their land to defend or give up. Players can use the structure of the map and the coordinated action of other players to gain defensible footholds in order to take more area and eventually be the last player on the board.</p>

<p>A full game of the final product released on Steam played on a Windows computer.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>I built Land War over the course of 7 months and 400 hours of work using Unity with C#. Though art requirements were intentionally low for a video game, I still had to produce several hundred static graphics and GIFs, and commissioned custom music for the menu and gameplay.</p>
<p>This project is one of my favorite examples of what can be done in relatively little time with a focused vision and a constant eye on scope creep. From the very start, I knew that a key to making compelling software was to flesh out the core concept before all else. This is why I started on the most fundamental strategic interaction of the players and built an MVP version of the game without a menu, sound, art, or even a win condition.</p>
<p>I started the project on a Memorial Day Monday, and by Friday had a rudimentary prototype playable with 8 players on Nintendo Joy-Con controllers paired to a Windows machine via Bluetooth.<br>
This is what the project looked like for my first play-test with other people 5 days in:</p>

        <span style="display: block; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">4-player game played with Nintendo Joy-Cons on a build of the game from 5 days into development.</span>
    
</div>

<p>From there, I continued to work on depth and full feature functionality including menus, a tutorial, a map generator, a dynamic scoring and round system, better sound and sprite graphics, different play modes and settings, and support for many controllers. I released the game with very little marketing aside from some Reddit posts and a physical handout at E3 but was happy to receive positive reviews and several hundred purchases of the game.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Control Panel</strong> is a hardware project I designed in 2016 to manage home automation systems. The project involved designing a custom 3D-printed case for a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a touchscreen interface.</p>

<p>I created this panel display in 2016 to control much of the home automation I used in my Studio City apartment. Mainly a hardware project, I designed and 3D-printed a case and frame for the touchscreen and raspberry pi microcomputer in order to mount them to the wall. The software running the control panel is SaaS, but I did write a custom html wrapper to control the orientation and settings of the site, which is available on the github linked above.</p>
<p>Update in 2025: This panel is still my main view into my home automation in my new house in Sherman Oaks, almost 10 years in with no modification!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video to see the panel in action:</p>

<p>If you want to make this, all you need to do is set up a raspberry pi, download chromium (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to your action tiles panel.</p>
<p>If you want to mount the screen vertically like mine, then I have made an easier solution than going through the trouble of actually rotating the raspberry&rsquo;s display and touch device. Just use the html below and edit it to use your own panel&rsquo;s URL in the &ldquo;iframe&rdquo; element instead of mine. This will launch the panel rotated in your browser.</p>

<p>Play time is about 20 minutes for the 3-5 player version, and 25-30 minutes for the 6-8 player version. Learning how to play the game takes 1-5 minutes depending on the attention span of the players. Have fun!</p>

<p>3D-Print 88 tokens.</p>
<p>2D-Print the 2 included PDFs back-to-back, so that the numbers appear on the one side and the identical backsides are on the back. Or, leave out the backs as they are not necessary to play the game. Cut 9 cards out of each paper when they&rsquo;re done printing, along the gray lines.</p>
<p>It is recommended to either print on heavy duty paper, or to laminate the resulting cards.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make your own layout with larger or smaller cards using the included zip file of images.</p>
<p>For the 3-5 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 35. For the 6-8 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 46.</p>
<h1 id="to-play">To Play:</h1>
<p>Here is a link to the 3-5 player instructions:

<p>The 6-8 player instructions are almost exactly the same as the 3-5 player game:
-All players still receive 11 tokens at the beginning of the game.
-Play with the 3-46 deck, shuffle the deck, and remove 11 cards instead of 9 cards before playing.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Printing:
Print in ABS if possible. ABS is dishwasher safe (will not warp) and PLA is not. Print it hot to make it waterproof, if possible. I used .15 mm layers for the top and .25 mm layers for the base, and 30% fill for both. I would highly recommend a layer height of .15 or less for the top part, as there are a lot of small features you don&rsquo;t want your printer glossing over.</p>
<h3 id="assembly">Assembly:</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need some small-gauge wire and pliers to finish the assembly of this thing. I used 28 gauge stainless steel wire, but anything 28 gauge or smaller and waterproof should work. Don&rsquo;t use fishing line because it flexes too much to work. Actual metal wire is needed.</p>
<p>Loop and tie the wire through one of the four mounting holes near the four corners of the top piece. Then weave the rest of the wire through the 20 holes (10 on each side) starting with the one immediately below the mounting hole you started with. Try to keep the wire as tight as possible with each weave. Finish by tying the other end of your wire to the remaining mounting hole on the side you started on.</p>
<p>Your wires are probably not tight enough at this point. Make sure the two ends are tied securely, and then grab your pliers. There is a small, vertical, raised wall with a notch in it between each hole on the outer edge of the top piece. Using the pliers, lift the wire into the notch on as many of the outer wire loops as possible in order to tighten it.</p>
<h3 id="operation">Operation:</h3>
<p>Peel your hard-boiled egg and place it on the base sideways. Push the top piece through the base and the wires. If you want your egg diced, lift it off the base, remove the top pieces of the slicer, put the egg back down rotated 90 degrees and proceed to dice your egg.</p>
<p>Soak in warm soapy water to wash it before storing.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>You will need two 4mm-wide wall hooks (the kind used to mount pictures). Make sure they conduct and are attracted to magnets. You will also need a hot glue gun.
Print two of the attached STL files (one of the mountable variety if you plan to mount it). Flatten the wall hooks with a hammer to get them completely flat, and lay the first one on one of your printed pieces leaving about a half an inch to spare from one end, and hanging out the other. Place a dab of hot glue on the end where it is hanging off. Do the same with the other half, and then place the halves together so the metal pieces are not quite touching in the middle. Seal the metal in place with hot glue.</p>
<p>The hot glue lets the metal move slightly, so that one metal piece bends to touch the other when a magnet is near either side of the switch, completing the circuit between the two metal ends still sticking out.</p>]]></description>

I&rsquo;ve redesigned and re-released these coasters! <a href="/8-bit-coasters-10-year">Check out the 10 year anniversary edition.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you like retro video games and also drinking things, you&rsquo;re in luck!
This full set of 8 unique video game coasters comes with themed coaster holders for sets of either 4 or 8! Print them for your living room! Print them for your friends!
I hope these characters remind you of some of your favorite series.</p>
