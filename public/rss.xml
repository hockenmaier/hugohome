                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I came across this tweet today that was surprisingly contentious. Maybe not so surprising given the state of Twitter, but still:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1762321041899012307">https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1762321041899012307</a></p>
<p>On the face of it, “people get twisted in their relationship with work” seems like a reasonable take. Stop complaining—you are making 16x the median salary in this country. Just do the boring job with the toxic team.</p>
<p>Let’s stop and think about this for a second. The original poster (OP from now on) is making $800K annually due to the appreciation of Spotify stock. An obscene amount of money? Maybe, maybe not. I do not have the typical hang-ups about the wealthy or ultra-wealthy. I don’t see this world as a zero-sum game, and I think the richest people out there have usually done some amazing things, especially in countries like the US where most wealth is not old wealth.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between founding a company you’re passionate about, which goes on to become incredibly valuable, and working for someone else doing a job you think is boring in order to join the 1%. In this article, I’m talking about the latter.</p>
<p>I propose this core question for this type of person: Is this large income worth doing a job you find boring, or working with people you feel are toxic? I would say no. Absolutely not. OP is clearly regretting how he’s spending his time at work. He should look for something to do that he values, even if it pays a quarter as much as he gets now. Or less!</p>
<h3 id="the-hedonic-treadmill">The Hedonic Treadmill</h3>
<p>There’s an often misquoted study from ~2010 that personal income beyond about $75K (presumed to cover basic necessities with a comfortable overhead) does not equate to further happiness. This number is actually about right when it comes to simple reported happiness, which has more to do with the hedonic treadmill than anything else. But the study in question was also measuring reported “life satisfaction” as surveyed, which did not stop increasing with income. Of course, “life satisfaction” is a fraught survey metric as well, as it might actually measure a perceived comparative number with one’s neighbors (we’ll get to this later).</p>
<p>But whatever the proper measure of happiness or satisfaction is, there is a great deal of logic to thinking its relationship with income looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/treadmill-graph.png" alt="Hedonic Treadmill Curve"></p>
<figure><img src="/images/treadmill-graph.png"
    alt="Alt text" width="50%">
</figure>

<p>As in: there are diminishing returns to incremental income. Not a revolutionary idea. It’s obvious. But it also means that somewhere along this curve is the often-quoted $75K, and somewhere far to the right is OP’s $800K. And the curve between those points is probably pretty flat.</p>
<p>What could OP get in return for moving to the left along this flat section of the curve? Eight hours of time per workday, at least, that he finds incrementally more valuable. How much do you think those 8 hours could improve his life satisfaction on their own happiness/hours curve?</p>
<p>This is where the real paradox comes in. Gaining wealth is supposed to make your time more valuable. You choose to get more services, have a housekeeper, maybe even a private chef. But if those things actually indicate a person values their time more highly than someone poorer, how come they would even consider sacrificing most of that time doing something they find boring, or with people they find annoying? Just to maintain their position along the flat section of the curve?</p>
<p>Maybe they aren’t prioritizing happiness at all.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-up-with-the-joneses">Keeping up with the Joneses</h3>
<p>My argument so far would be absolute blasphemy to most of the $500K+ salary people who don’t have much fun at work. Let’s talk about their two most common counterarguments:</p>
<p><strong>1. “Work should be a sacrifice, and more money means more security for my family.”</strong></p>
<p>This is noble. It’s also way too self-sacrificial for the extremely wealthy first-world people we’re talking about. You’re making $800K. There is not a salary sacrifice in the world that will make your family “insecure.”</p>
<p>And what pattern does this even establish? You’re going to choose to be unhappy for most of your waking hours so that you can guarantee your children will be able to do the same? What are you actually working for if not you or anyone else being able to actually enjoy themselves?</p>
<p><strong>2. “But I could make this crazy money and then retire in 5 years.”</strong></p>
<p>Now this is a good argument! You could indeed retire in 5 years after making $800K per year and then spend your time with family or pursue passion projects! The problems here are twofold:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, nobody does this. Instead, they spend more money. Of course, some of it will be saved, but the main thing that happens when people find themselves with far more money than needed for their family’s security is that they spend it. Bigger houses, more trips, elite schools for the kids. These make you feel well-off compared to your neighbors but don’t push you much higher on that flat curve.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, people find value in being useful. There’s a reason why so many struggle in retirement. Even with a rigid FIRE plan, you’ll still want to work afterward on something interesting. So why not find that now?</p>
<p>What’s actually happening? Lifestyle creep. I think this is 90% of why people feel they could never work on something more fun or meaningful for less money. They’ve already started to spend their new money, and now losing those things would hurt more than gaining them felt good. That damn hedonic treadmill.</p>
<h3 id="where-we-go-from-here">Where we go from here</h3>
<p>What am I saying? I’m asking you to think deeply about what you value. Money isn’t a core value. Value your own time as much as your spending habits suggest you do. This is the right logic for your well-being, even if the world stays as it is. Now for my last thought:</p>
<p>I’m obsessed with AI and the technological singularity. It’s a healthy time to step back, reflect on the fundamental values driving our behavior, and make changes. Wouldn’t it be silly to spend most of our waking hours working miserably on meaningless things, only to arrive in a second half of life in a world of abundance?</p>

<p>Treekeepers VR is a networked VR game where up to 4 players can cooperate to navigate an oversized world and save a giant tree.</p>
<p>Treekeepers is in production on both Quest (standalone VR) and Steam (PC VR) with full cross-play functionality. See the <a href="https://togetheragainstudios.com/treekeepersvr/">Treekeepers VR Website</a> for links to all storefronts and more detail about the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I began working on Treekeepers in June 2021, and my primary goal was to go significantly deeper into Unity and make a fully networked game. Very few co-op games existed in VR at the time (the area is still lacking), and my intention was to answer this need and create a game that 4 players could cooperate in within a static frame of reference (players move within a ship, and the ship moves through the world) while having to solve coordination challenges together.</p>
<p>I initially designed the project for SteamVR only using the SteamVR SDK but quickly realized that a VR game released only on PC would miss the majority of the userbase, as the (then Oculus) Quest 2 was quickly dominating the market. Treekeepers was a good fit for a mobile platform with its simple low-poly cel-shaded design, so I pivoted to using OpenXR about two months into the project to support VR interactions on both PC and mobile (Android) devices like the Quest 2.</p>
<p>By summer 2022, I had a releasable product, albeit only with one “world” available. I decided to push the game to early access to gather rapid feedback from real players, and after getting approved for both storefronts, Treekeepers released to early access on September 30, 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Human Joystick VR</strong> explores a hybrid locomotion system where players move through a virtual environment by physically changing their position within their VR playspace.</p>
<p>Link to the project: <a href="https://github.com/hockenmaier/humanjoystick">Human Joystick on Github</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Human Joystick&rdquo; solves a common VR problem: providing natural movement in large virtual environments. Players can physically move within a playspace, but once they approach the edge, the system detects the movement vector and shifts the playspace accordingly.</p>
<p>This allows players to explore vast virtual spaces while maintaining immersion and reducing nausea.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>This project was my first VR experience, designed to address virtual movement challenges. Inspired by consumer VR’s limitations in 2016, I aimed to merge physical and artificial locomotion for a more natural experience.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deadzone and active zone</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players remain stationary when in the center (deadzone).</li>
<li>Movement starts when stepping into the active zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjustable speed and direction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed scales with distance from the center.</li>
<li>Supports smooth transitions between directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite achieving basic functionality, there were usability issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recentering difficulty</strong>: Players struggled to naturally return to the center without visual aids.</li>
<li><strong>Directional accuracy</strong>: Switching movement directions without recentralizing was less intuitive than expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>Watch the system in action:</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The core concept of Land War is an ultra-simplified RTS. Players expand their territories and strategically decide which side of their land to defend or sacrifice when encountering opponents. By leveraging the map structure and coordinating with others, players aim to outlast their opponents.</p>
<p><img src="/images/land_war_settings.png" alt="Settings menu"></p>

<p>First Ten is powered by a serverless backend built on AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. The voice input is processed by Google&rsquo;s Dialogflow, which extracts user intents and parameters to guide interactions.</p>
<p>This project leverages the potential of Voice User Interfaces (VUI), offering a hands-free way to learn about the U.S. Bill of Rights, similar to Alexa Skills. Users can interact with the app by asking natural-language questions or commands.</p>
