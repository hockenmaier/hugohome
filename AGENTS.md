# Repo Instructions

This repository hosts the Hugo-based personal website **Hockenworks**. Key background references are in the notes folder:

- `notes/site-description.md` describes the website, its Hugo setup, and how the Ball Machine integrates with the site.
- `notes/ball-machine-context.md` outlines the structure of the Ball Machine physics simulation game and guidance for editing its code.

Consult these files for context when making changes.
