If you like retro video games and also drinking things, you're in luck!
Print them for your living room! Print them for your friends!
I hope these characters remind you of some of your favorite series.

I returned to [this project](/8-bit-coasters) after 10 years to make more coasters, including some designs for multi-plastic printers and a reinforced 4-coaster holder!

It was super fun returning to this project! I was able to fix a few things that I had noticed failing over the years, like the new reinforced sides to the "? Block" holder. Now that multi-color prints are proliferating more widely, I'm hoping people can use the new colored files - they really pop with the Silk+Matte PLA combo I used here. Links to those filaments:

If you have a Bambulab printer, there is an included .3mf file with coloring and print settings ready to go!

Also pictured (third to last picture) are 18 of my favorite remixed coasters from my original thing. Find them in the remixes of the link above!

I've included an openscad file for customizing multiple sizes of pixel art for your own designs, based on the awesome customizable version by ahtly here:
