I made "Postman for PMs," a tool to help non-engineers understand and use APIs!

<!--more-->

{{< youtube 3O4r_q2Ioko >}}

It's a "Custom GPT" - a customized version of chatGPT. Just give it some details about the API and then tell it in English what you want to get, post, update, whatever.

If you're a PM, business analyst, or anyone that cares about APIs but doesn't like terminals and engineer-y tools like Postman, and you have ChatGPT plus, try it out. Here's a link:

Important disclaimer: DON'T use ChatGPT on corporate stuff if your company doesn't allow it! This was a fun experiment for me and I'm definitely not using any corporate resources on it/for it. There are plenty of free APIs to try this out on. Maybe ask ChatGPT for some suggestions
