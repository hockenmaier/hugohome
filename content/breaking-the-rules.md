Notes:

The times I have been most successful in my career are the times I broke the rules. Mostly soft rules, like the idea of what I was "supposed" to be getting paid for. The biggest time being when I built ragpile in my spare time.

I remember getting this advice early on in my career from a mentor - that you always need to be doing your job, plus something else. Maybe it was from Ashish?

I think there are many reasons that this is likely true in large organizations - but a reason it is getting more and more true, is because "order taking" is one of the easiest skills to learn, and becoming less and less relevant as we create AIs good at taking orders.

Ideas to incorporate:
