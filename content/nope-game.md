# Print Instructions

3D-Print 88 tokens.

2D-Print the 2 included PDFs back-to-back, so that the numbers appear on the one side and the identical backsides are on the back. Or, leave out the backs as they are not necessary to play the game. Cut 9 cards out of each paper when they're done printing, along the gray lines.

It is recommended to either print on heavy duty paper, or to laminate the resulting cards.

You can also choose to make your own layout with larger or smaller cards using the included zip file of images.

For the 3-5 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 35. For the 6-8 player game, print the cards numbered 3 to 46.

# To Play:

Here is a link to the 3-5 player instructions:

The 6-8 player instructions are almost exactly the same as the 3-5 player game:
-All players still receive 11 tokens at the beginning of the game.
-Play with the 3-46 deck, shuffle the deck, and remove 11 cards instead of 9 cards before playing.
