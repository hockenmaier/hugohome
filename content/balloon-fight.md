Today's post is about another half finished game that either I or AI will finish one day. I'm gaining a bit of a repertoire of those. This is one that I started when AI image generation started to become decent. It's a game that I've always wanted to exist but with my current skill sets, I could never pull off without a lot of commissioning due to the art requirements.

The idea is not as original as some of my games but it's very fun when played in a large group. Essentially, I combine the gameplay of the NES classic balloon fight with eight-player multiplayer. If you've played my game Land war, you might know that I'm a bit obsessed with eight player multiplayer, or really specifically anything that's more than four players which is where most video games typically max out.

# Eight-player video games

I love to have people over to socialize, and I love to game. I think they are honestly one of the best ways to have productive, good natured socialization where people can do things like band together, rib on each other a bit, and sometimes even feel like they've seen something beautiful or had a new experience together. I know that's a little philosophical and sappy, but I think there's a huge place for video games in actual socialization, similar to how board games have a place.

And I love board games. I play them all the time. But so often when playing board games you run into mechanics that are only there because the game doesn't have a computer involved, can't count for you, can't add things up, can't simulate multiple players turns at the same time, and though it's nice to not have any screens in front of anybody, I think the limitations of board games hold people back from playing games as a group in general more often than not.

My favorite example of this is power grid {inline image of board game cover}, a game that is clever and would be really quite fun if it didn't require players to spend half their time literally doing simple math in their heads or on paper while other people waited. A modern video game with similar dynamics would never do that, it would just let you play the fun part.

But video games have their own limitations and requirements. Aside from the stuff that we aren't getting around anytime before true augmented reality is on everybody's faces, like getting a controller and everybody's hands, and getting them over the fact that they are looking at a screen to socialize, video games have one fundamental limitation most of the time which is that they only go up to four players. And most social gatherings involve more than four people.

This is the core reason I wanted to make land war an eight-player strategy game, and this setting of group gatherings was also why the controls for land war are so dead simple. More about land war [here](/land-war)
