The Advent of general coding AI assistants almost immediately changed my own hiring practices and advice to my team.

This was pretty easy for me psychologically because I had always had a bias against the types of coding questions that I personally do badly at - specifically ones that require knowledge or rote memory of specific language capabilities, libraries, syntax. The only types of coding questions I would personally ask before are things that simply evaluate whether a candidate is lying or not about whether they can code, which is surprisingly common. I have interviewed people that list things like 7 years of Java experience but can't pass a fizz buzz like question, and this was a question I gave out on paper with a closed door and no significant time pressure.

So, when LLMS that could remember any syntax or attribute of any programming language perfectly were released, not only was I excited but I immediately saw that a huge chunk of the programming questions my team and many other software teams liked to ask were essentially irrelevant now, not only because people could cheat on interviews, at least virtually, but because that knowledge simply lost a lot of value overnight.

Over a few conversations with friends and colleagues I began to explore the idea of what this meant generally for the interview process. There are just lots of questions that we ask in every field, it turns out, that are mostly solved by LLMS that have memorized most useful information, even when the original intent of the interview question was to test for experience.

Notes to finish:

Ad that I wanted to test my hypothesis
Explanation For why I chose unity
No frameworks like lying chain, probably looks very archaic now compared to new LLM based apps because of how fast things are moving
But works surprisingly well
Open source
