This was a board game I "cloned" back in 2015, but newly redesigned in 2024 with resized pieces and a self-contained custom game box and instructions printed right into the box.

I love small games that travel well, and this game is about the same depth and nearly 1/4th the area of the original box - thus "pocket". It's a snug fit but nicely sectioned out for all pieces. Have fun!

## Hocken-Pocket-Blokus Print Instructions

If you have a multi-filament printer, check out the new 3mf for "Hocken Pocket Blokus" - a self contained full blokus game and box with a hinged lid, and game instructions printed into the box.

You can also print the lid and box STLs separately, but if you choose to do that, remember: the pocket version that the box and lid are made for requires scaling the board and pieces: X scaled to 70%, Y scaled to 70% and Z scaled to 115%.

## Original Print Instructions

To print the board, print 4 of the "Playing Board Quarter" file. These should have the right level of tolerance to fit snugly but not too tight.

To print the pieces, you can either use the full plate set of 21 pieces, or pick and choose from the individual files. The file names represent the number of squares in each piece, as well as a word description of what the piece looks like.

Make sure the board and all sets of pieces are distinct colors of plastic.
