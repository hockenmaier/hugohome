I have been occasionally challenging GPT to create models using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), a "programming language for 3D models"

Both struggle, but GPT-4 has been a massive improvement. Here are both models' outputs after asking for an acorn and 3 messages of me giving feedback:

For the record, it is impressive that these LLMs can get anything right with no visual input or training on shapes like these. Imagine looking at the programming reference for openSCAD and trying to do this blind. The fact that the 3.5 version has a bunch of strangely intersecting primitives and some union issues has been normal in my experience. It takes quite a bit of spatial logic to get a model not to look like that.
