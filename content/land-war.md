## Gameplay  

The core concept of Land War is an ultra-simplified RTS. Players expand their territories and strategically decide which side of their land to defend or sacrifice when encountering opponents. By leveraging the map structure and coordinating with others, players aim to outlast their opponents.

## Development  

Land War was developed over 7 months and 400 hours using Unity and C#. Despite its simple art requirements, the project involved producing hundreds of static graphics and gifs. Custom music was commissioned for menus and gameplay.  

From the outset, the focus was on refining the core gameplay. A functional prototype was created within 5 days, tested with 8 players using Nintendo Joy-Cons.
