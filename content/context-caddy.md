I built a nice little tool to help AI write code for you.

Well, really, o3-mini and o3-mini-high worked together to write this and I corrected a few things here and there. I started using this tool to write itself about 30 mins into development!

Download on github https://github.com/hockenmaier/context-caddy
Or the VScode marketplace:

And reminder - if you are writing code for a company NEVER put code into an AI model that company doesnâ€™t approve :)
