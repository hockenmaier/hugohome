## Development  

First Ten is powered by a serverless backend built on AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. The voice input is processed by Google's Dialogflow, which extracts user intents and parameters to guide interactions.  

This project leverages the potential of Voice User Interfaces (VUI), offering a hands-free way to learn about the U.S. Bill of Rights, similar to Alexa Skills. Users can interact with the app by asking natural-language questions or commands.
