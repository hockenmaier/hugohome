Here's a peek at my first major board game creation!

I've made a few clones or slight enhancements of games I like before like [Nope](/nope-game) and [Hocken-Pocket-Blokus](/hocken-pocket-blokus), but Bloom or Bust is my first attempt at something of my own design with very high production quality.

This is a risk-taking game where players compete to take over a tree with their specific type of fruit. Trees and bees are becoming a recurring theme in my games!

All parts of this game are hand-designed by me, mostly in VR with a tool called gravity Sketch, blender, and one of my favorite programmer's 3D tools called OpenSCAD.

Of all my models, this one takes most advantage of my multicolor BambuLab printer. All parts including the custom box which cleverly incorporates the instructions and game board itself are printed in BambuLab Matte PLA, which in my opinion is the most beautiful way to print.

Production is batched with 80 to 150 of each fruit or bee on a build plate, with overall production heavily limited by the game board and latching box each requiring a separate print.

I have looked into outsourcing production of this game so that I can actually distribute it, but that has not happened yet. Its design is totally dependent on multicolor 3D printing, and most print farms would require nearly $30 just to produce it, let alone shipping it and any margin. Injection molding is an option but also gets expensive with this level of detailed color, and requires remodeling in several significant ways. It still might happen. Or I might put it out on a site that lets people buy the model and print it themselves.

I'll post in the future about how I decide to distribute this. If you really want to buy one now, contact me - but as of now I need to charge about $100 for a set.
