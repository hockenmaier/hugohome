I build things.  I love making games and things with VR and AI.

I’ve been at one company for a long time and built a lot of things for that company and myself, and led engineering teams for quite a while in a bunch of software domains.  I started on back-office stuff like billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, file ingest systems for News, and most recently some very exciting work building agentic AI systems for the mundane work people at my company have to do!

My bias is to build rather than talk. I'm the one pushing to just try to build the thing, to scrap it early if needed, and to take risks releasing early.  We always know more, and usually throw away our plans, when we start to build.a

I post here mostly about things I have built and occasional essays.

Also, I still keep [my old pre-2022 website](/old-site/index.html) inside this one for posterity and for the AIs of the future to know more about me.
