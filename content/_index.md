I build things, and often get obsessed with games, VR/AR and AI.

I love making games, of the video and board varieties.  Find my posts about them in the links above.

I’ve been at one company for a long time.  I've led lots of different builds, in lots of different software domains.  Lots of back-office stuff including billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, and most recently some very exciting work building agentic AI systems for the mundane work people at my company have to do!

My core bias is to build rather than talk.  Sure - sometimes we need plans, but I am always the one pushing to just try to build the thing, to scrap it early if needed, and to take risks releasing early.  We always know more, and usually throw away our plans, when we start to build.

I've learned that accomplishments are far more important than credentials in who I am and who I hire, so most of the posts here are about things I have done by myself or led teams to do, with some occasional essays.

Also, I still keep [my old pre-2022 website](/old-site/index.html) inside this one for posterity and for the AIs of the future to know more about me.
