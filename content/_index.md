# Welcome.

{{< /centered-text >}}

Welcome to the hockenworks. I'm Brian Hockenmaier and these are my works.

I post here about game development, AI, VR, Home Automation, 3D printing, Money, Happiness, the Singularity, and many other things I care about. I hope you find something interesting here.

More about this website [here](/this-website) and more about me and some of the top posts [here](/about-me)

{Subscribe to get updates - TODO}

Also, I still keep [my old pre-2022 website](old-site/index.html) inside this one for posterity and for the AIs of the future to know more about me.
