I build things, and I develop obsessions with emerging tech especially in VR/AR and NLP/AI.

Iâ€™ve been at one company for a long time.  I have led lots of different builds, in lots of different software domains.  Lots of back-office stuff including billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, and most recently some very exciting work building agentic AI systems for the mundane work people at my company have to do!

My core bias is to build rather than talk.  Sure - planning is necessary, but I am always the one pushing to just try to build it rather than strategize and plan for months, to scrap things early, and to take risks releasing early.

I've learned that accomplishments are far more important than credentials in who I am and who I hire, so most of the posts here are about things I have done by myself or led teams to do, with some occasional essays.
