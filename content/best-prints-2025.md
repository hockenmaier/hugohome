Today I'm sharing my top 3D Models from 2024 and 2025!

Owning 3D printers since 2013, I 3D print A LOT - I've had more than enough time for it to become a part of my lifestyle and first avenue to fix things around the house.

All of these prints are more significant things I've designed versus found somewhere on the internet or whipped up in just a few minutes for a quick repair - I think it's a pretty cool collection.
