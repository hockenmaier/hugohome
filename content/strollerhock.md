Here's my most patriotic print yet! I have been using our new (hand-me-down) stroller a lot lately, for obvious reasons, and I decided there were a few things I just couldn't go without.

So, I made a one-print solution that requires zero support and attaches to the handle of any stroller with hose clamps, which are shown here covered by separate printed strap covers to protect the leather of the stroller handle. I've deemed it the Strollerhock:

I couldn't resist printing it in my red, white, and blue ABS since its first real test run would be in Coronado, CA for the 4th of July weekend.

The Strollerhock includes:

- A battery holder for a 40K mAh rechargeable battery (about 8 smartphones' worth)
- A baby fan mount, powered by the battery
- Two phone mount positions, both of which can be used while the phone is charging from the battery
- A paper or cash clip
- A key hook
- A pacifier compartment
- A multi-width tapered cupholder

I may have gone a little overboard on design on this one - probably 8+ hours of design and print prep, but it did come in handy walking all around the island! I am still adding finishing touches, but for anyone interested, here is the first complete versions of the Strollerhock and the clamp cover straps:
