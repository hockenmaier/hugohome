I'm Brian Hockenmaier: dad, engineer, and fun-haver.

{family}

{education, learn by doing}

I’ve been at one company for a long time and have built a lot there, led some big teams, and released several things on my own too, in a bunch of different software domains. I started on back-office - things like billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, file ingest systems for TV news content, and several games and tools outside of work. Most recently I'm making some pretty awesome stuff in agentic AI for the mundane work that the people at my company have to do!

My bias is to build rather than talk. I'm the one pushing to just try to build the thing, to scrap it early if needed, and to take risks releasing early. We always know more, and usually throw away our plans, when we start to build. I love building strange things, useful thingss, fun things. One of the things I built was this website and the game running on top of it it. [Read more about that here](/this-website)
