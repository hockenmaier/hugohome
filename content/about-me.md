I'm Brian Hockenmaier, dad, engineer, and fun haver.

I grew up in Ventura, California with two UCLA-engineer parents. Even though neither of them were engineers long-term, I was an engineering child. I was always building something, highlights including a functional submarine and weather balloon with Lego robotics.

I went to school for industrial engineering at [Cal Poly SLO](https://www.calpoly.edu/), nearly double majored in economics, and then promptly moved out of both fields just like my parents had moved out of their education fields of mechanical and aerospace. Since then, after reading Ray Kurzweil's [The Singularity is Near](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near) in 2011, feeling I needed to be closer to software and realizing I liked building systems more than anything in industrial engineering, I've built a career in software and then AI.

At work, I try to be high time preference, high autonomy, low consensus (even contrarian), high invention, process-light.

I've been at one company for a long time for a millennial. I've built a lot of enterprise software and four high performing software teams. I started on back-office stuff like billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, and file ingest systems for News. Most recently I’m making some pretty awesome stuff in agentic AI for the mundane work that the people at my company have to do!

My bias is to build rather than talk. I'm the one pushing to just try to build the thing, to scrap it early if needed, and to take risks releasing early. I figure that we always know more, and usually throw away our plans, when we start to build. I love building strange things, useful thingss, fun things. One of the things I built was this website and the game running on top of it. [Read more about that here](/this-website)

# Where to start

I post here mostly about things I'm making and occasional essays. If you’re interested in this site but don’t know where to start, try reading any of these posts that sound interesting to you. They're either peices or projects I put a lot of time into.

## My Games
