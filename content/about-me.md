I'm Brian Hockenmaier, dad, engineer, and fun haver.

I grew up in Ventura, California with two UCLA-engineer parents. Even though neither of them were engineers long-term, I was an engineering child. I was always building something, highlights including a functional submarine and weather balloon with Lego robotics.

I went to school for industrial engineering at [Cal Poly SLO](https://www.calpoly.edu/), nearly double majored in economics, and then promptly moved out of both fields just like my parents had moved out of their education fields of mechanical and aerospace. Since then, after reading Ray Kurzweil's [The Singularity is Near](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near) in 2011, feeling I needed to be closer to software and realizing I liked building systems more than anything in industrial engineering, I've built a career in software and then AI.

At work, I try to be low time preference, high autonomy, low consensus (even contrarian), high invention, process-light.

I've been at one company for a long time for a millennial. I've built a lot of enterprise software and four high-performing software teams. I started on back-office stuff like billing systems, TV scheduling systems, IP rights management systems, and file ingest systems for News. Most recently I’m making some pretty awesome stuff in agentic AI for the mundane work that the people at my company have to do!

My bias is to build rather than talk. I'm the one pushing to just try to build the thing, to scrap it early if needed, and to take risks releasing early. I figure that we always know more, and usually throw away our plans, when we start to build. I love building strange things, useful things, fun things. One of the things I built was this website and the game running on top of it. [Read more about that here](/this-website)

# Where to start

I post here mostly about things I'm making and occasional essays. If you’re interested in this site but don’t know where to start, try reading any of these posts that sound interesting to you. They're either pieces or projects I put a lot of time into.

## Video Games

I've been developing video games on and off since 2017 or so. This has entailed more than 6 project starts and 3 finishes - those are below.

&nbsp;

{{< single-with-image path="/land-war">}}

> Land War was my first published video game, released using Unity after many unfinished starts in HTML5 and Unreal Engine. I put myself on a tight timeline, built in 6 months in my spare time and released on Steam only, where it got a few hundred downloads and made a bit over $1000

{{< single-with-image path="/treekeepers-vr">}}

> Treekeepers VR was an ambitious game development project I took on in 2021- my first published VR title and my first multiplayer title. The latter turned out to be the really hard part. It's now free on two platforms. Read more about it:

## Top 3D Prints

I've been 3D Modeling since Cal Poly and printing since I got my first printer - the MakerGearM2 - in 2013. I have dozens of designs on thingiverse, some of which got pretty popular. A lot of my best work is made up of 3D printed games and game paraphernalia.

&nbsp;

{{< single-with-image path="/bloom-or-bust">}}

> Bloom Or Bust is my latest and best board game. Fully designed from scratch using OpenSCAD and Gravity Sketch (A very fun VR-based 3D Modeling program)
